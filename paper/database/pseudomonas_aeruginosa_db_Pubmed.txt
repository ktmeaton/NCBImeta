4	31481541	2019	Nov	15		Electronic-Print	Journal Article	Journal of bacteriology	J. Bacteriol.	1098-5530	Modulating Pathogenesis with Mobile-CRISPRi.	Conditionally essential (CE) genes are required by pathogenic bacteria to establish and maintain infections. CE genes encode virulence factors, such as secretion systems and effector proteins, as well as biosynthetic enzymes that produce metabolites not found in the host environment. Due to their outsized importance in pathogenesis, CE gene products are attractive targets for the next generation of antimicrobials. However, the precise manipulation of CE gene expression in the context of infection is technically challenging, limiting our ability to understand the roles of CE genes in pathogenesis and accordingly design effective inhibitors. We previously developed a suite of CRISPR interference-based gene knockdown tools that are transferred by conjugation and stably integrate into bacterial genomes that we call Mobile-CRISPRi. Here, we show the efficacy of Mobile-CRISPRi in controlling CE gene expression in an animal infection model.

Previous studies have demonstrated substantial genetic diversification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa across sub-compartments in cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs. Here, we isolate P. aeruginosa from five different sampling areas in the upper and lower airways of an explanted CF lung, analyze ex vivo transcriptional profiles by RNA-seq, and use colony re-sequencing and deep population sequencing to determine the genetic diversity within and across the various sub-compartments. We find that, despite genetic variation, the ex vivo transcriptional profiles of P. aeruginosa populations inhabiting different regions of the CF lung are similar. Although we cannot estimate the extent to which the transcriptional response recorded here actually reflects the in vivo transcriptomes, our results indicate that there may be a common in vivo transcriptional profile in the CF lung environment.	10	1	3397	10.1038/s41467-019-11414-3	Kordes;Preusse;Willger;Braubach;Jonigk;Haverich;Warnecke;Häussler	Adrian;Matthias;Sven D;Peter;Danny;Axel;Gregor;Susanne	Institute for Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE, Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Institute for Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, 38124, Germany.;Institute for Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE, Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Institute for Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, 38124, Germany.;Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Biomedical Research in Endstage and Obstructive Lung Disease Hannover (BREATH), German Center for Lung Research (Deutsches Zentrum für Lungenforschung [DZL]), Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Biomedical Research in Endstage and Obstructive Lung Disease Hannover (BREATH), German Center for Lung Research (Deutsches Zentrum für Lungenforschung [DZL]), Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Biomedical Research in Endstage and Obstructive Lung Disease Hannover (BREATH), German Center for Lung Research (Deutsches Zentrum für Lungenforschung [DZL]), Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Department of Cardiothoracic, Transplant and Vascular Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Biomedical Research in Endstage and Obstructive Lung Disease Hannover (BREATH), German Center for Lung Research (Deutsches Zentrum für Lungenforschung [DZL]), Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Department of Cardiothoracic, Transplant and Vascular Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Institute for Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE, Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, Hannover, 30625, Germany. susanne.haeussler@helmholtz-hzi.de.;Institute for Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, 38124, Germany. susanne.haeussler@helmholtz-hzi.de.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

The virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, is regulated by many transcriptional factors (TFs) that control the expression of quorum sensing and protein secretion systems. Here, we report a genome-wide, network-based approach to dissect the crosstalk between 20 key virulence-related TFs. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), as well as RNA-seq, we identify 1200 TF-bound genes and 4775 differentially expressed genes. We experimentally validate 347 of these genes as functional target genes, and describe the regulatory relationships of the 20 TFs with their targets in a network that we call 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomic regulatory network' (PAGnet). Analysis of the network led to the identification of novel functions for two TFs (ExsA and GacA) in quorum sensing and nitrogen metabolism. Furthermore, we present an online platform and R package based on PAGnet to facilitate updating and user-customised analyses.	10	1	2931	10.1038/s41467-019-10778-w	Huang;Shao;Xie;Wang;Zhang;Wang;Deng	Hao;Xiaolong;Yingpeng;Tingting;Yingchao;Xin;Xin	Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, 999077, China.;Key Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Technology, Ministry of Education, TEDA Institute of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Nankai University, 23 Hongda Street, Tianjin, 300457, China.;Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, 999077, China.;Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, 999077, China.;Key Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Technology, Ministry of Education, TEDA Institute of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Nankai University, 23 Hongda Street, Tianjin, 300457, China.;Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, 999077, China. xin.wang@cityu.edu.hk.;Shenzhen Research Institute, City University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, 518057, China. xin.wang@cityu.edu.hk.;Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, 999077, China. xindeng@cityu.edu.hk.;Shenzhen Research Institute, City University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, 518057, China. xindeng@cityu.edu.hk.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish
9	31217473	2019	Jun	19		Electronic	Journal Article	Scientific reports	Sci Rep	2045-2322	Pseudomonas donghuensis HYS virulence towards Caenorhabditis elegans is regulated by the Cbr/Crc system.	Pseudomonas donghuensis HYS is the type strain of a recently identified species, P. donghuensis, which has pathogenic potential with an unclear virulence mechanism. In this study, we used Caenorhabditis elegans as a host to explore the virulence mechanism of P. donghuensis HYS. Based on a correlation between P. donghuensis HYS virulence and its repellence property, we identified 68 potential virulence-related genes, among them the Cbr/Crc system, which regulates the virulence of prokaryotic microorganisms. Slow-killing assays indicated that cbrA, cbrB, or specific sRNA-encoding genes all affected P. donghuensis virulence positively, whereas crc affected it negatively. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated that the Cbr/Crc system played an important role in the pathogenesis of P. donghuensis. In addition, experiments using the worm mutant KU25 pmk-1(km25) showed a correlation between P. donghuensis HYS virulence and the PMK-1/p38 MAPK pathway in C. elegans. In conclusion, our data show that Crc plays a novel role in the Cbr/Crc system, and the P. donghuensis virulence phenotype therefore differs from that of P. aeruginosa. This process also involves C. elegans innate immunity. These findings significantly increase the available information about Cbr/Crc-based virulence mechanisms in the genus Pseudomonas.	9	1	8772	10.1038/s41598-019-45145-8	Xie;Zeng;You;Xie	Guanfang;Man;Jia;Zhixiong	Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine (Ministry of Education), Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, P.R.

13	31024494	2019				Electronic-eCollection	Journal Article	Frontiers in microbiology	Front Microbiol	1664-302X	Response of	The bacterial quorum sensing phenomenon has been well studied since its discovery and has traditionally been considered to include signaling pathways recognized exclusively within either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. These groups of bacteria synthesize structurally distinct signaling molecules to mediate quorum sensing, where Gram-positive bacteria traditionally utilize small autoinducing peptides (AIPs) and Gram-negatives use small molecules such as acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs). The structural differences between the types of signaling molecules have historically implied a lack of cross-talk among Gram-positive and Gram-negative quorum sensing systems. Recent investigations, however, have demonstrated the ability for AIPs and AHLs to be produced by non-canonical organisms, implying quorum sensing systems may be more universally recognized than previously hypothesized. With that in mind, our interests were piqued by the organisms	10		715	10.3389/fmicb.2019.00715	Spangler;Dean;Leary;Walper	Joseph R;Scott N;Dagmar H;Scott A	National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowships, NRC Research Associateship Programs, Washington, DC, United States.;National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowships, NRC Research Associateship Programs, Washington, DC, United States.;United States Naval Research Laboratory, Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, Washington, DC, United States.;United States Naval Research Laboratory, Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, Washington, DC, United States.	eng		PubMed-not-MEDLINE	epublish

Acinetobacter baumannii is a growing threat, although lytic bacteriophages have been shown to effectively kill A. baumannii. However, the interaction between the host and the phage has not been fully studied. We demonstrate the global profile of transcriptional changes in extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii AB1 and the interaction with phage φAbp1 through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatic analysis. Only 15.6% (600/3,838) of the genes of the infected host were determined to be differentially expressed genes (DEGs), indicating that only a small part of the bacterial resources was needed for φAbp1 propagation. Contrary to previous similar studies, more upregulated rather than downregulated DEGs were detected. Specifically, φAbp1 infection caused the most extensive impact on host gene expression at 10 min, which was related to the intracellular accumulation phase of virus multiplication. Based on the gene coexpression network, a middle gene (	4	2		10.1128/mSystems.00068-19	Yang;Yin;Li;Wang;Huang;Jiang;You;Gong;Zhang;Luo;Peng;Zhao	Zichen;Supeng;Gang;Jing;Guangtao;Bei;Bo;Yali;Cheng;Xiaoqiang;Yizhi;Xia	State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.;Bioinformatics Center, Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.;Bioinformatics Center, Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.;Bioinformatics Center, Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.	eng		PubMed-not-MEDLINE	epublish

In a given habitat, bacterial cells often experience recurrent exposures to the same environmental stimulus. The ability to memorize the past event and to adjust current behaviors can lead to efficient adaptation to the recurring stimulus. Here we demonstrate that the versatile bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa adopts a virulence phenotype after serial passage in the invertebrate model host Galleria mellonella. The virulence phenotype was not linked to the acquisition of genetic variations and was sustained for several generations, despite cultivation of the ex vivo virulence-adapted P. aeruginosa cells under rich medium conditions in vitro. Transcriptional reprogramming seemed to be induced by a host-specific food source, as reprogramming was also observed upon cultivation of P. aeruginosa in rich medium supplemented with polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids. The establishment of induced memory responses adds a time dimension and seems to fill the gap between long-term evolutionary genotypic adaptation and short-term induced individual responses. Efforts to unravel the fundamental mechanisms that underlie the carry-over effect to induce such memory responses will continue to be of importance as hysteretic behavior can serve survival of bacterial populations in changing and challenging habitats.	13	8	2018-2030	10.1038/s41396-019-0412-1	Kordes;Grahl;Koska;Preusse;Arce-Rodriguez;Abraham;Kaever;Häussler	Adrian;Nora;Michal;Matthias;Alejandro;Wolf-Rainer;Volkhard;Susanne	Department of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, 38124, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, 38124, Germany.;Department of Chemical Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, 38124, Germany.;Research Core Unit Metabolomics and Institute of Pharmacology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, 30625, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE Centre for Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, Hannover, 30625, Germany.

Lung alveolar type I cells (AT1) and alveolar type II cells (AT2) regulate the structural integrity and function of alveoli. AT1, covering ∼95% of the surface area, are responsible for gas exchange, whereas AT2 serve multiple functions, including alveolar repair through proliferation and differentiation into AT1. However, the signaling mechanisms for alveolar repair remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced acute lung injury in mice, that non-canonical Notch ligand Dlk1 (delta-like 1 homolog) is essential for AT2-to-AT1 differentiation. Notch signaling was activated in AT2 at the onset of repair but later suppressed by Dlk1. Deletion of Dlk1 in AT2 induced persistent Notch activation, resulting in stalled transition to AT1 and accumulation of an intermediate cell population that expressed low levels of both AT1 and AT2 markers. Thus, Dlk1 expression leads to precisely timed inhibition of Notch signaling and activates AT2-to-AT1 differentiation, leading to alveolar repair.	26	11	2942-2954.e5	10.1016/j.celrep.2019.02.046	Finn;Sottoriva;Pajcini;Kitajewski;Chen;Zhang;Malik;Liu	Johanna;Kilian;Kostandin V;Jan K;Chang;Wei;Asrar B;Yuru	Department of Pharmacology, The University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60612, USA; The Center for Lung and Vascular Biology, The University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.;Department of Pharmacology, The University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.;Department of Pharmacology, The University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.;Department of Physiology and Biophysics, The University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.;Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA; Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.;Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.;Department of Pharmacology, The University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60612, USA; The Center for Lung and Vascular Biology, The University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.;Department of Pharmacology, The University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60612, USA; The Center for Lung and Vascular Biology, The University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as a genetically tractable animal host in which to study evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of innate immune signaling. We previously showed that the PMK-1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway regulates innate immunity of C. elegans through phosphorylation of the CREB/ATF bZIP transcription factor, ATF-7. Here, we have undertaken a genomic analysis of the transcriptional response of C. elegans to infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, combining genome-wide expression analysis by RNA-seq with ATF-7 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq). We observe that PMK-1-ATF-7 activity regulates a majority of all genes induced by pathogen infection, and observe ATF-7 occupancy in regulatory regions of pathogen-induced genes in a PMK-1-dependent manner. Moreover, functional analysis of a subset of these ATF-7-regulated pathogen-induced target genes supports a direct role for this transcriptional response in host defense. The genome-wide regulation through PMK-1- ATF-7 signaling reveals a striking level of control over the innate immune response to infection through a single transcriptional regulator.	15	2	e1007830	10.1371/journal.pgen.1007830	Fletcher;Tillman;Butty;Levine;Kim	Marissa;Erik J;Vincent L;Stuart S;Dennis H	Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.;Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.;BioMicro Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.;BioMicro Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.;Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) are ligand-gated transcription factors that control adaptive host responses following recognition of specific endogenous or exogenous ligands. Although NHRs have expanded dramatically in C. elegans compared to other metazoans, the biological function of only a few of these genes has been characterized in detail. Here, we demonstrate that an NHR can activate an anti-pathogen transcriptional program. Using genetic epistasis experiments, transcriptome profiling analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing, we show that, in the presence of an immunostimulatory small molecule, NHR-86 binds to the promoters of immune effectors to activate their transcription. NHR-86 is not required for resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa at baseline, but activation of NHR-86 by this compound drives a transcriptional program that provides protection against this pathogen. Interestingly, NHR-86 targets immune effectors whose basal regulation requires the canonical p38 MAPK PMK-1 immune pathway. However, NHR-86 functions independently of PMK-1 and modulates the transcription of these infection response genes directly. These findings characterize a new transcriptional regulator in C. elegans that can induce a protective host response towards a bacterial pathogen.	15	1	e1007935	10.1371/journal.pgen.1007935	Peterson;Cheesman;Liu;Anderson;Foster;Chhaya;Perrat;Thekkiniath;Yang;Haynes;Pukkila-Worley	Nicholas D;Hilary K;Pengpeng;Sarah M;Kyle J;Richa;Paola;Jose;Qiyuan;Cole M;Read	Program in Innate Immunity, Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Program in Innate Immunity, Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Program in Innate Immunity, Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Program in Innate Immunity, Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Program in Innate Immunity, Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Department of Neurobiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Program in Innate Immunity, Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Program in Innate Immunity, Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

Co-colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus is frequent in cystic fibrosis patients. Polymicrobial infections involve both detrimental and beneficial interactions between different bacterial species. Such interactions potentially indirectly impact the human host through virulence, antibiosis and immunomodulation.;Here we explored the responses triggered by the encounter of these two pathogens to identify early processes that are important for survival when facing a potential competitor. Transcriptional profiles of both bacteria were obtained after 3 h co-culture and compared to the respective mono-culture using RNAseq. Global responses in both bacteria included competition for nitrogen sources, amino acids and increased tRNA levels. Both organisms also induced lysogenic mechanisms related to prophage induction (S. aureus) and R- and F- pyocin synthesis (P. aeruginosa), possibly as a response to stress resulting from nutrient limitation or cell damage. Specific responses in S. aureus included increased expression of de novo and salvation pathways for purine and pyrimidine synthesis, a switch to glucose fermentation, and decreased expression of major virulence factors and global regulators.;Taken together, transcriptomic data indicate that early responses between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus involve competition for resources and metabolic adaptations, rather than the expression of bacteria- or host-directed virulence factors.	20	1	30	10.1186/s12864-018-5398-y	Tognon;Köhler;Luscher;van Delden	Mikaël;Thilo;Alexandre;Christian	Transplant Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospitals of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.;Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, University of Geneva, 1, rue Michel Servet, CH-1211, Genève 4, Switzerland.;Transplant Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospitals of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland. thilo.kohler@unige.ch.;Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, University of Geneva, 1, rue Michel Servet, CH-1211, Genève 4, Switzerland. thilo.kohler@unige.ch.;Transplant Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospitals of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.;Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, University of Geneva, 1, rue Michel Servet, CH-1211, Genève 4, Switzerland.;Transplant Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospitals of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.;Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, University of Geneva, 1, rue Michel Servet, CH-1211, Genève 4, Switzerland.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

The huge increase in the availability of bacterial genomes led us to a point in which we can investigate and query pan-genomes, for example, the full set of genes of a given bacterial species or clade. Here, we used a data set of 1,311 high-quality genomes from the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 619 of which were newly sequenced, to show that a pan-genomic approach can greatly refine the population structure of bacterial species, provide new insights to define species boundaries, and generate hypotheses on the evolution of pathogenicity. The 665-gene P. aeruginosa core genome presented here, which constitutes only 1% of the entire pan-genome, is the first to be in the same order of magnitude as the minimal bacterial genome and represents a conservative estimate of the actual core genome. Moreover, the phylogeny based on this core genome provides strong evidence for a five-group population structure that includes two previously undescribed groups of isolates. Comparative genomics focusing on antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes showed that variation among isolates was partly linked to this population structure. Finally, we hypothesized that horizontal gene transfer had an important role in this respect, and found a total of 3,010 putative complete and fragmented plasmids, 5% and 12% of which contained resistance or virulence genes, respectively. This work provides data and strategies to study the evolutionary trajectories of resistance and virulence in P. aeruginosa.	11	1	109-120	10.1093/gbe/evy259	Freschi;Vincent;Jeukens;Emond-Rheault;Kukavica-Ibrulj;Dupont;Charette;Boyle;Levesque	Luca;Antony T;Julie;Jean-Guillaume;Irena;Marie-Josée;Steve J;Brian;Roger C	Département de microbiologie-infectiologie et immunologie, Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Québec City, Quebec, Canada.;Département de microbiologie-infectiologie et immunologie, Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Québec City, Quebec, Canada.;Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec (CRIUCPQ), Québec City, Quebec, Canada.;Département de Biochimie, De Microbiologie et de Bio-informatique, Université Laval, Québec City, Quebec, Canada.;Département de microbiologie-infectiologie et immunologie, Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Québec City, Quebec, Canada.;Département de microbiologie-infectiologie et immunologie, Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Québec City, Quebec, Canada.;Département de microbiologie-infectiologie et immunologie, Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Québec City, Quebec, Canada.;Département de microbiologie-infectiologie et immunologie, Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Québec City, Quebec, Canada.;Département de microbiologie-infectiologie et immunologie, Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Québec City, Quebec, Canada.;Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec (CRIUCPQ), Québec City, Quebec, Canada.;Département de Biochimie, De Microbiologie et de Bio-informatique, Université Laval, Québec City, Quebec, Canada.;Département de microbiologie-infectiologie et immunologie, Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Québec City, Quebec, Canada.;Département de microbiologie-infectiologie et immunologie, Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Québec City, Quebec, Canada.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a donor which provides the methyl groups for histone or nucleic acid modification and phosphatidylcholine production. SAM is hypothesized to link metabolism and chromatin modification, however, its role in acute gene regulation is poorly understood. We recently found that Caenorhabditis elegans with reduced SAM had deficiencies in H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at pathogen-response genes, decreasing their expression and limiting pathogen resistance. We hypothesized that SAM may be generally required for stress-responsive transcription. Here, using genetic assays, we show that transcriptional responses to bacterial or xenotoxic stress fail in C. elegans with low SAM, but that expression of heat shock genes are unaffected. We also found that two H3K4 methyltransferases, set-2/SET1 and set-16/MLL, had differential responses to survival during stress. set-2/SET1 is specifically required in bacterial responses, whereas set-16/MLL is universally required. These results define a role for SAM in the acute stress-responsive gene expression. Finally, we find that modification of metabolic gene expression correlates with enhanced survival during stress.	14	11	e1007812	10.1371/journal.pgen.1007812	Ding;Higgins;Yadav;Godbole;Pukkila-Worley;Walker	Wei;Daniel P;Dilip K;Adwait A;Read;Amy K	Program in Molecular Medicine, UMASS Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Department of Computer Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States of America.;Program in Molecular Medicine, UMASS Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Program in Molecular Medicine, UMASS Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Program in Innate Immunity, Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, UMASS Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.;Program in Molecular Medicine, UMASS Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States of America.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

The first outbreak in Japan of GES-5 carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred in a long-term care facility in 2014. To assess the spread of GES-5 producing P. aeruginosa clinical isolates in medical settings in Japan, 1,476 carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from 2012 to 2016 were characterized. Of these 1,476 isolates, 104 (7.0%) harbored blaGES-5. Southern blotting revealed that the blaGES-5 was located on the chromosome. The isolation rates of these GES-5 producers increased significantly every year, from 2.0% (6 of 295) in 2012 to 2.8% (8 of 283) in 2013 to 5.3% (16 of 303) in 2014 to 9.7% (29 of 300) in 2015 to 15.3% (45 of 295) in 2016. Of the 104 GES-5 producers, 102 belonged to clonal complex (CC) 235, including 99 belonging to ST235 and three belonging to ST2233). Whole genome sequence analysis revealed that CC235 P. aeruginosa harboring blaGES-5 spread in a clonal manner. These results indicate that these GES-5 producing CC235 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates have spread in medical settings throughout Japan.	13	11	e0207134	10.1371/journal.pone.0207134	Hishinuma;Tada;Kuwahara-Arai;Yamamoto;Shimojima;Kirikae	Tomomi;Tatsuya;Kyoko;Norio;Masahiro;Teruo	Department of Microbiology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.;Department of Microbiology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.;Department of Microbiology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.;Department of Microbiology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.;BML Inc., Kawagoe, Saitama, Japan.;Department of Microbiology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.	eng	Microb Drug Resist. 2017 Jun;23(4):457-461;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Sep;53(9):3908-13;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2008 Jun;31(6):527-30;Genome Biol Evol. 2017 Dec 1;9(12):3238-3245;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Sep;45(9):2598-603;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Nov;53(11):4930-3;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Nov;54(11):4872-8;Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2016 Feb;35(2):195-200;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Apr;56(4):2169-72;J Microbiol Methods. 2011 Dec;87(3):330-7;J Clin Microbiol. 2013 Dec;51(12):4281-3;J Hosp Infect. 2016 May;93(1):35-41;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Sep;49(9):3734-42;Drug Resist Updat. 2015 Jul-Aug;21-22:41-59;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2008 Jan;14 Suppl 1:42-52;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2000 Mar;44(3):622-32;PLoS One. 2018 Sep 28;13(9):e0204936;J Clin Microbiol. 2017 Dec;55(12):3405-3410;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2007 Jul;20(3):440-58, table of contents;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 Jan;55(1):349-54;J Bacteriol. 2011 Dec;193(24):7010;J Clin Microbiol. 2015 Jun;53(6):1996-8;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2006 Jun;57(6):1261-2;J Clin Microbiol. 2007 Mar;45(3):979-89;Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 2014 Mar;78(3):292-4;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2004 May 15;234(2):209-13;Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 2007 Aug;58(4):465-8;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2018 Mar;24(3):258-266;BMC Microbiol. 2015 Feb 21;15:41;J Clin Microbiol. 2017 Sep;55(9):2858-2864;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2004 Aug;48(8):2905-10;Syst Biol. 2010 May;59(3):307-21;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1997 Oct;41(10):2289-91	MEDLINE	epublish

Pseudomonas spp. are endowed with a complex pathway for glucose uptake that relies on multiple transporters. In this work we report the construction and characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa single and multiple mutants with unmarked deletions of genes encoding outer membrane (OM) and inner membrane (IM) proteins involved in glucose uptake. We found that a triple ΔgltKGF ΔgntP ΔkguT mutant lacking all known IM transporters (named GUN for Glucose Uptake Null) is unable to grow on glucose as unique carbon source. More than 500 genes controlling both metabolic functions and virulence traits show differential expression in GUN relative to the parental strain. Consistent with transcriptomic data, the GUN mutant displays a pleiotropic phenotype. Notably, the genome-wide transcriptional profile and most phenotypic traits differ between the GUN mutant and the wild type strain irrespective of the presence of glucose, suggesting that the investigated genes may have additional roles besides glucose transport. Finally, mutants carrying single or multiple deletions in the glucose uptake genes showed attenuated virulence relative to the wild type strain in Galleria mellonella, but not in Caenorhabditis elegans infection model, supporting the notion that metabolic functions may deeply impact P. aeruginosa adaptation to specific environments found inside the host.	8	1	16912	10.1038/s41598-018-35087-y	Raneri;Pinatel;Peano;Rampioni;Leoni;Bianconi;Jousson;Dalmasio;Ferrante;Briani	Matteo;Eva;Clelia;Giordano;Livia;Irene;Olivier;Chiara;Palma;Federica	Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy.;Istituto di Tecnologie Biomediche-CNR, Segrate, Italy.;Istituto di Tecnologie Biomediche-CNR, Segrate, Italy.;Istituto Clinico Humanitas-CNR, Rozzano, Italy.;Dipartimento di Scienze, Università degli Studi Roma Tre, Roma, Italy.;Dipartimento di Scienze, Università degli Studi Roma Tre, Roma, Italy.;Centre for Integrative Biology, Università degli Studi di Trento, Trento, Italy.;Centre for Integrative Biology, Università degli Studi di Trento, Trento, Italy.;Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy.;Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy.;Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy. federica.briani@unimi.it.	eng	Virulence. 2016 Apr 2;7(3):214-29;Med Arch. 2014 Jun;68(3):163-6;Chest. 2018 Feb;153(2):507-514;Infect Immun. 2000 Apr;68(4):2359-62;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Dec 1;106(48):20440-5;Int J Med Microbiol. 2010 Dec;300(8):549-56;Mol Microbiol. 2001 May;40(4):917-31;J Bacteriol. 2007 Jul;189(13):4827-36;Nat Methods. 2012 Mar 04;9(4):357-9;J Gen Physiol. 1956 Jul 20;39(6):853-68;FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 1999 Dec;26(3-4):259-65;J Bacteriol. 2007 Jul;189(14):5142-52;Front Microbiol. 2018 Jan 09;8:2671;J Bacteriol. 1990 Feb;172(2):884-900;Mol Microbiol. 1992 Nov;6(22):3415-25;Mol Gen Genet. 1998 May;258(3):250-9;J Bacteriol. 2007 Sep;189(17):6372-81;Biochem J. 1976 Mar 15;154(3):659-68;J Bacteriol. 2010 Feb;192(4):1113-21;Science. 1993 May 21;260(5111):1127-30;Science. 1998 Apr 10;280(5361):295-8;J Vis Exp. 2012 Jun 10;(64):e4019;Adv Exp Med Biol. 2012;710:11-7;Adv Appl Microbiol. 2014;86:1-40;J Appl Microbiol. 2018 Aug 28;:null;Pathogens. 2017 Oct 21;6(4):null;J Vis Exp. 2012 Dec 11;(70):e4392;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jul;42(12):7654-63;Microb Biotechnol. 2018 May;11(3):442-454;Environ Microbiol. 2018 Oct;20(10):3484-3503;J Gen Microbiol. 1976 Feb;92(2):304-10;J Bacteriol. 2000 Nov;182(21):5990-6;Protein Cell. 2015 Jan;6(1):26-41;Environ Microbiol. 2015 Nov;17(11):4379-93;Microbiology. 2012 Apr;158(Pt 4):1057-70;Sci Rep. 2017 Nov 27;7(1):16331;J Bacteriol. 2011 Sep;193(17):4307-16;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 May 29;115(22):E5125-E5134;Curr Protoc Microbiol. 2005 Jul;Chapter 1:Unit 1B.1;Gene. 1991 Dec 20;109(1):137-41;J Invertebr Pathol. 2014 Jan;115:14-25;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2006 Mar;30(2):274-91;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jun;12(6):1399-412;Proc Nutr Soc. 2006 Aug;65(3):227-35;Zoolog Sci. 2013 May;30(5):345-51;PLoS One. 2017 Jul 7;12(7):e0180887;Sci Rep. 2016 Jun 08;6:27636;Gene. 2000 Aug 8;253(2):323-30;J Vis Exp. 2011 Jan 20;(47):null;J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(7):2331-9;Infect Immun. 2007 Jan;75(1):175-83;J Bacteriol. 1993 Dec;175(24):7793-800;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1984;38:359-88;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Sep;45(5):1177-90;Mol Microbiol. 2000 Aug;37(3):561-73;Am J Med. 1982 Mar;72(3):439-50;J Biomol Screen. 2015 Jun;20(5):627-33;J Gerontol. 1979 Jan;34(1):28-36;Drugs. 2007;67(3):351-68;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Feb;57(2):996-1005;FEBS Open Bio. 2014 Apr 04;4:377-86;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Mar 2;96(5):2408-13;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2017 Sep 1;41(5):698-722;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jun;186(12):3855-61;J Bacteriol. 1999 Aug;181(16):4890-5;ACS Infect Dis. 2018 Feb 9;4(2):185-195	MEDLINE	epublish

A1137 were subjected to genome sequencing. The complete nucleotide sequences of two plasmids (p60512-IMP from the 60512 isolate and p447-IMP from the 447 isolate) and two chromosomes (the 12939 and A1137 isolates) were determined, then a genomic comparison of p60512-IMP, p447-IMP and four novel blaIMP-carrying transposons (Tn6394, Tn6375, Tn6411 and Tn6397) with related sequences was performed. Transferability of the blaIMP gene and bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility were tested.;Tn6394 and Tn6375 were located in p60512-IMP and p447-IMP, respectively, while Tn6411 and Tn6397 were integrated into the 12939 and A1137 chromosomes, respectively. Tn6394 was an ISPa17-based transposition unit that harboured the integron In992 (carrying blaIMP-1). In73 (carrying blaIMP-8), In73 and In992, together with the ISEcp1:IS1R-blaCTX-M-14-IS903D unit, the macAB-tolC region and the truncated aacC2-tmrB region, respectively, were integrated into the prototype transposons Tn1722, Tn1696 and Tn7, respectively, generating the Tn3-family unit transposons, Tn6375 and Tn6378, and the Tn7-family unit transposon Tn6411, respectively. Tn6397 was a large integrative and conjugative element carrying Tn6378.;Complex events of transposition and homologous recombination have occurred during the original formation and further plasmid and chromosomal integration of these four transposons, promoting accumulation and spread of antimicrobial resistance genes.	73	11	3005-3015	10.1093/jac/dky288	Zhan;Hu;Jiang;Zeng;Feng;Wu;Chen;Yang;Yang;Gao;Yin;Zhou	Zhe;Lingfei;Xiaoyuan;Lijun;Jiao;Weili;Weijun;Huiying;Wenhui;Bo;Zhe;Dongsheng	Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.;State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China.;Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.;Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China.;Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.;State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

U.S.A.	1091-6490	Cellular hysteresis as a principle to maximize the efficacy of antibiotic therapy.	Antibiotic resistance has become one of the most dramatic threats to global health. While novel treatment options are urgently required, most attempts focus on finding new antibiotic substances. However, their development is costly, and their efficacy is often compromised within short time periods due to the enormous potential of microorganisms for rapid adaptation. Here, we developed a strategy that uses the currently available antibiotics. Our strategy exploits cellular hysteresis, which is the long-lasting, transgenerational change in cellular physiology that is induced by one antibiotic and sensitizes bacteria to another subsequently administered antibiotic. Using evolution experiments, mathematical modeling, genomics, and functional genetic analysis, we demonstrate that sequential treatment protocols with high levels of cellular hysteresis constrain the evolving bacteria by (	115	39	9767-9772	10.1073/pnas.1810004115	Roemhild;Gokhale;Dirksen;Blake;Rosenstiel;Traulsen;Andersson;Schulenburg	Roderich;Chaitanya S;Philipp;Christopher;Philip;Arne;Dan I;Hinrich	Antibiotic Resistance Evolution Group, Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Biology, 24306 Plön, Germany.;Department of Evolutionary Ecology and Genetics, Zoological Institute, Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, 24118 Kiel, Germany.;Antibiotic Resistance Evolution Group, Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Biology, 24306 Plön, Germany.;Antibiotic Resistance Evolution Group, Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Biology, 24306 Plön, Germany.;Department of Evolutionary Ecology and Genetics, Zoological Institute, Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, 24118 Kiel, Germany.;Department of Evolutionary Ecology and Genetics, Zoological Institute, Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, 24118 Kiel, Germany.;Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, 24105 Kiel, Germany.;Antibiotic Resistance Evolution Group, Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Biology, 24306 Plön, Germany.;Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, SE- 751 23 Uppsala, Sweden.;Antibiotic Resistance Evolution Group, Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Biology, 24306 Plön, Germany; hschulenburg@evolbio.mpg.de.;Department of Evolutionary Ecology and Genetics, Zoological Institute, Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, 24118 Kiel, Germany.	eng	Science. 2014 Oct 17;346(6207):1245993;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2016 Apr;14(5):320-30;Lancet. 1988 Sep 24;2(8613):749-50;J Bacteriol. 2006 Mar;188(5):1847-55;PLoS Biol. 2013;11(4):e1001540;Science. 1962 Mar 23;135(3508):1067-8;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2008;62:193-210;PLoS Pathog. 2014 Jun 26;10(6):e1004225;PLoS Genet. 2014 Sep 25;10(9):e1004556;PLoS Genet. 2013;9(8):e1003706;Evolution. 1995 Feb;49(1):151-163;Sci Signal. 2014 May 13;7(325):ra44;Nat Commun. 2017 Jun 08;8:15589;J Biochem. 2005 Mar;137(3):395-400;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2000 Dec;44(12):3322-7;Science. 1995 Jun 30;268(5219):1899-902;Nat Protoc. 2011 Dec 15;7(1):80-8;N Engl J Med. 2015 Nov 12;373(20):1986-8;PLoS Biol. 2018 Apr 30;16(4):e2004356;PLoS Biol. 2015 Apr 08;13(4):e1002104;Mol Biol Evol. 2017 Sep 1;34(9):2229-2244;PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56858;Sci Transl Med. 2013 Sep 25;5(204):204ra132;Nature. 2014 Sep 18;513(7518):418-21;Lancet Infect Dis. 2016 Feb;16(2):161-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Aug;87(15):5589-93;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Aug;83(16):6164-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Oct 7;111(40):14494-9;Lett Appl Microbiol. 1996 Oct;23(4):269-72;Trends Microbiol. 2016 May;24(5):377-390;J Bacteriol. 1952 Oct;64(4):489-99;Nature. 2005 Aug 25;436(7054):1171-5;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Sep 16;105(37):13977-81;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Dec 19;103(51):19484-9;Evol Appl. 2015 Dec;8(10):945-55;Wistar Inst Symp Monogr. 1967;5:81-94	MEDLINE	ppublish

Biotechnol.	1432-0614	Medium chain unsaturated fatty acid ethyl esters inhibit persister formation of Escherichia coli via antitoxin HipB.	Persisters represent a small bacterial population that is dormant and that survives under antibiotic treatment without experiencing genetic adaptation. Persisters are also considered one of the major reasons for recalcitrant chronic bacterial infections. Although several mechanisms of persister formation have been proposed, it is not clear how cells enter the dormant state in the presence of antibiotics or how persister cell formation can be effectively controlled. A fatty acid compound, cis-2-decenoic acid, was reported to decrease persister formation as well as revert the dormant cells to a metabolically active state. We reasoned that some fatty acid compounds may be effective in controlling bacterial persistence because they are known to benefit host immune systems. This study investigated persister cell formation by pathogens that were exposed to nine fatty acid compounds during antibiotic treatment. We found that three medium chain unsaturated fatty acid ethyl esters (ethyl trans-2-decenoate, ethyl trans-2-octenoate, and ethyl cis-4-decenoate) decreased the level of Escherichia coli persister formation up to 110-fold when cells were exposed to ciprofloxacin or ampicillin antibiotics. RNA sequencing analysis and gene deletion persister studies elucidated that these fatty acids inhibit bacterial persistence by regulating antitoxin HipB. A similar persister cell reduction was observed for pathogenic E. coli EDL933, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, and Serratia marcescens ICU2-4 strains. This study demonstrates that fatty acid ethyl esters can be used to disrupt bacterial dormancy to combat persistent infectious diseases.	102	19	8511-8524	10.1007/s00253-018-9271-3	Wang;Fang;Hong;Kim;Jang;Hong	Mengya;Kuili;Sung Min Choi;Inwha;Ik-Soon;Seok Hoon	Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, 60616, USA.;Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, 60616, USA.;Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, 60616, USA.;Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, 60616, USA.;Division of Bioconvergence Analysis, Korea Basic Science Institute, Daejeon, 305-333, Republic of Korea.;Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, 60616, USA. shong26@iit.edu.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Infect.	1532-2742	Diverse bacterial species contribute to antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and gastrointestinal damage.	Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) caused by C. difficile is one of the most common nosocomial infections, however, little is known about infections related to antimicrobial use for pathogens other than C. difficile. We therefore aimed to provide insight into other bacterial causes of AAD, and how infection with these pathogens causes damage in the dysbiotic gut.;Clinical isolates from C. difficile-negative AAD patients were whole genome sequenced for in silico analysis of potential virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. A mouse model of infection was developed to assess the capacity of these isolates to cause gastrointestinal damage, which was analysed by studying specific markers in the gastrointestinal mucosa of infected mice.;Several bacterial pathogens were isolated from patients with C. difficile-negative AAD. Each isolate showed the potential for virulence based on encoded virulence factors, as well as most showing antimicrobial resistance in vitro. Isolates of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were tested in the mouse model of infection, inducing damage primarily in the small intestine, affecting adherens junction integrity, cellular polarity, and cellular proliferation.;Several pathogens of clinical importance other than C. difficile are able to cause gastrointestinal infection following antimicrobial-mediated dysbiosis. The virulence potential and multidrug resistance identified in these isolates illuminates the importance of further diagnostic screening in cases of C. difficile-negative AAD.	77	5	417-426	10.1016/j.jinf.2018.06.006	Larcombe;Hutton;Riley;Abud;Lyras	Sarah;Melanie L;Thomas V;Helen E;Dena	Infection and Immunity Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Microbiology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.;Infection and Immunity Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Microbiology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.;Department of Microbiology, PathWest Laboratory Medicine; School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University; School of Veterinary and Life Sciences, Murdoch University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.;Cancer Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.;Infection and Immunity Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Microbiology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.

Lett.	1574-6968	Genomic characterisation of an international Pseudomonas aeruginosa reference panel indicates that the two major groups draw upon distinct mobile gene pools.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen, especially in the context of infections of cystic fibrosis (CF). In order to facilitate coordinated study of this pathogen, an international reference panel of P. aeruginosa isolates was assembled. Here we report the genome sequencing and analysis of 33 of these isolates and 7 reference genomes to further characterise this panel. Core genome single nucleotide variant phylogeny demonstrated that the panel strains are widely distributed amongst the P. aeruginosa population. Common loss-of-function mutations reported as adaptive during CF (such as in mucA and mexA) were identified amongst isolates from chronic respiratory infections. From the 40 strains analysed, 37 unique resistomes were predicted, based on the Resistance Gene Identifier method using the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database. Notably, hierarchical clustering and phylogenetic reconstructions based on the presence/absence of genomic islands (GIs), prophages and other regions of genome plasticity (RGPs) supported the subdivision of P. aeruginosa into two main groups. This is the largest, most diverse analysis of GIs and associated RGPs to date, and the results suggest that, at least at the largest clade grouping level (group 1 vs group 2), each group may be drawing upon distinct mobile gene pools.	365	14		10.1093/femsle/fny120	Freschi;Bertelli;Jeukens;Moore;Kukavica-Ibrulj;Emond-Rheault;Hamel;Fothergill;Tucker;McClean;Klockgether;de Soyza;Brinkman;Levesque;Winstanley	Luca;Claire;Julie;Matthew P;Irena;Jean-Guillaume;Jérémie;Joanne L;Nicholas P;Siobhán;Jens;Anthony;Fiona S L;Roger C;Craig	Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology (IBIS), University Laval, Québec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.;Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.;Institute of Microbiology, University Hospital Center and University of Lausanne, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology (IBIS), University Laval, Québec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology (IBIS), University Laval, Québec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology (IBIS), University Laval, Québec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology (IBIS), University Laval, Québec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institute of Microbiology, University Hospital Center and University of Lausanne, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.;Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow G4 0RE, UK.;Centre of Microbial Host Interactions, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Tallaght, Dublin D24 FKT9, Ireland.;Clinic for Paediatric Pneumology, Allergology, and Neonatology, Hannover Medical School, D-30625, Hannover, Germany.;Institute for Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE2 4HH, UK.;Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology (IBIS), University Laval, Québec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

45	29777834	2018	Nov			Print-Electronic	Journal Article	Research in microbiology	Res. Microbiol.	1769-7123	Erwinia amylovora phage vB_EamM_Y3 represents another lineage of hairy Myoviridae.	To date, a small number of jumbo myoviruses have been reported to possess atypical whisker-like structures along the surface of their contractile tails. Erwinia amylovora phage vB_EamM_Y3 is another example. It possesses a genome of 261,365 kbp with 333 predicted ORFs. Using a combination of BLASTP, Interproscan and HHpred, about 21% of its putative proteins could be assigned functions involved in nucleotide metabolism, DNA replication, virion structure and cell wall degradation. The phage was found to have a signal-arrest-release (SAR) endolysin (Y3_301) possessing a soluble lytic transglycosylase domain. Like other SAR endolysins, inducible expression of Y3_301 caused Escherichia coli lysis, which is dependent on the presence of an N-terminal signal sequence. Phylogenetic analysis showed that its closest relatives are other jumbo phages including Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage PaBG and P. putida phage Lu11, sharing 105 and 87 homologous proteins respectively. Like these phages, Y3 also shares a distant relationship to Ralstonia solanacearum phage ΦRSL1 (sharing 55 homologous proteins). As these phages are unrelated to the Rak2-like group of hairy phages, Y3 along with Lu11 represent a second lineage of hairy myoviruses.	169	9	505-514	10.1016/j.resmic.2018.04.006	Buttimer;Born;Lucid;Loessner;Fieseler;Coffey	Colin;Yannick;Alan;Martin J;Lars;Aidan	Department of Biological Sciences, Cork Institute of Technology, Cork, Ireland.

Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind bacteria-phage interactions remains limited. Here we report that a small protein, SrpA, controls core cellular processes in response to phage infection and environmental signals in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that SrpA is essential for efficient genome replication of phage K5, and controls transcription by binding to a palindromic sequence upstream of the phage RNA polymerase gene. We identify potential SrpA-binding sites in 66 promoter regions across the P. aeruginosa genome, and experimentally validate direct binding of SrpA to some of these sites. Using transcriptomics and further experiments, we show that SrpA, directly or indirectly, regulates many cellular processes including cell motility, chemotaxis, biofilm formation, pyocyanin synthesis and protein secretion, as well as virulence in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of infection. Further research on SrpA and similar proteins, which are widely present in many other bacteria, is warranted.	9	1	1846	10.1038/s41467-018-04232-6	You;Sun;Yang;Pan;Huang;Zhang;Gong;Fan;Li;Cui;Jing;Jin;Rao;Wu;Yang	Jiajia;Li;Xiaojing;Xuewei;Zhiwei;Xixi;Mengxin;Zheng;Lingyan;Xiaoli;Zhaoyuan;Shouguang;Zhiming;Weihui;Hongjiang	State

A large number of antisense transcripts have been detected in diverse microbial genomes and considerable effort has been devoted to elucidating the functional role of antisense transcription. In this study, we reanalysed extensive RNA sequencing data from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and found that the majority of genes have a propensity for antisense transcription. Although antisense transcripts were found in more than 80 % of the genes of the P. aeruginosa genome, the majority of sequencing reads were mapping sense and only a minority (<2 %) were mapping antisense to genes. Similarly to the sense expression levels, the antisense expression levels varied under different environmental conditions, with the sense and antisense expression levels often being inversely regulated and modulated by the activity of alternative sigma factors. Environment-modulated antisense transcription showed a bias towards being antisense to genes within regions of genomic plasticity and to those encoding small regulatory RNAs. In the future, the validation and functional characterization of antisense transcripts, and novel transcripts that are antisense to small regulatory RNAs in particular, have the potential to contribute to our understanding of the various levels of transcriptional regulation and its dynamics in the bacterial pathogen P. aeruginosa.	164	6	889-895	10.1099/mic.0.000664	Eckweiler;Häussler	Denitsa;Susanne	Present address: Institute of Microbiology and Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology, Braunschweig, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.;Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE, Centre of Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, Hannover, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.;Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE, Centre of Experimental and Clinical Infection Research, Hannover, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.	eng	Science. 2009 Nov 27;326(5957):1268-71;Nat Biotechnol. 2000 Dec;18(12):1262-8;RNA Biol. 2016;13(3):353-66;Science. 2012 Mar 2;335(6072):1103-6;J Bacteriol. 2010 May;192(9):2359-72;Mol Syst Biol. 2009;5:305;RNA Biol. 2010 Jan-Feb;7(1):84-9;J Bacteriol. 2013 Feb;195(3):444-52;J Bacteriol. 2014 Jan;196(2):345-56;Mol Cell. 2013 Nov 21;52(4):473-84;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;PLoS Pathog. 2012 Sep;8(9):e1002945;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Sep;73(6):1043-57;Mol Cell. 2015 Nov 19;60(4):597-610;PLoS Pathog. 2015 Mar 17;11(3):e1004744;MBio. 2015 Jun 30;6(4):e00749;PLoS One. 2015 Jul 29;10(7):e0133873;Transcription. 2014;5(4):e944039;MBio. 2010 May 18;1(1):null;Nat Rev Genet. 2010 Jan;11(1):9-16;Nature. 2010 Mar 11;464(7286):250-5;PLoS One. 2010 May 20;5(5):e10725;Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2013 Sep 01;3(9):a010298;BMC Genomics. 2014 Sep 11;15:783;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Feb 25;111(8):3134-9;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2007 Apr;10(2):102-9;PLoS One. 2009 Oct 19;4(10):e7526;Bioinformatics. 1998;14(1):48-54;Annu Rev Genet. 2010;44:167-88;Cell. 2009 Feb 20;136(4):615-28;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2014 Sep;12(9):647-53;Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 2009 Sep;10(9):637-43;Nat Biotechnol. 2009 Nov;27(11):1043-9;PLoS Pathog. 2012 Feb;8(2):e1002518;Methods. 2017 May 1;120:76-84;Sci Adv. 2016 Mar 04;2(3):e1501363;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Dec 22;106(51):21878-82;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2011 Jun;75(2):286-300;PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36553;RNA Biol. 2010 Jan-Feb;7(1):77-83	MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonads typically carry multiple non-identical alleles of the post-transcriptional regulator rsmA. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, RsmN is notable in that its structural rearrangement confers distinct and overlapping functions with RsmA. However, little is known about the specificities of RsmN for its target RNAs and overall impact on the biology of this pathogen. We purified and mapped 503 transcripts directly bound by RsmN in P. aeruginosa. About 200 of the mRNAs identified encode proteins of demonstrated function including some determining acute and chronic virulence traits. For example, RsmN reduces biofilm development both directly and indirectly via multiple pathways, involving control of Pel exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and c-di-GMP levels. The RsmN targets identified are also shared with RsmA, although deletion of rsmN generally results in less pronounced phenotypes than those observed for ΔrsmA or ΔrsmArsmNind mutants, probably as a consequence of different binding affinities. Targets newly identified for the Rsm system include the small non-coding RNA CrcZ involved in carbon catabolite repression, for which differential binding of RsmN and RsmA to specific CrcZ regions is demonstrated. The results presented here provide new insights into the intricacy of riboregulatory networks involving multiple but distinct RsmA homologues.	46	13	6823-6840	10.1093/nar/gky324	Romero;Silistre;Lovelock;Wright;Chan;Hong;Williams;Cámara;Heeb	Manuel;Hazel;Laura;Victoria J;Kok-Gan;Kar-Wai;Paul;Miguel;Stephan	School of Life Sciences, Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, University Park, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK.;School of Life Sciences, Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, University Park, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK.;School of Life Sciences, Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, University Park, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK.;School of Life Sciences, Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, University Park, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK.;International Genome Centre, Jiangsu University,Zhenjiang, China.;Division of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Institute of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Division of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Institute of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;School of Life Sciences, Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, University Park, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK.;School of Life Sciences, Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, University Park, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK.;School of Life Sciences, Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, University Park, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK.	eng	J Bacteriol. 1994 Oct;176(19):6007-14;J Bacteriol. 1993 Aug;175(15):4744-55;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2013 Mar;77(1):1-52;Environ Microbiol. 2013 Feb;15(2):313-24;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Feb;59(4):1114-28;Nat Methods. 2012 Mar 04;9(4):357-9;RNA. 2007 Nov;13(11):2042-50;J Bacteriol. 2007 Dec;189(23):8667-76;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Jun;72(5):1111-25;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Sep;65(6):1474-84;J Bacteriol. 2014 Dec;196(23):4081-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014 Sep;58(9):5084-95;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jul;76(13):4136-42;PLoS Pathog. 2009 Sep;5(9):e1000572;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;78(15):5060-9;Structure. 2013 Sep 3;21(9):1659-71;J Bacteriol. 2010 Feb;192(4):1113-21;J Bacteriol. 2017 Mar 28;199(8):;J Microbiol Methods. 2006 Mar;64(3):391-7;Mol Microbiol. 1997 Nov;26(4):621-9;J Bacteriol. 2014 Jan;196(2):357-66;Mol Microbiol. 2013 Feb;87(4):851-66;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;PLoS Pathog. 2012;8(8):e1002854;PLoS Genet. 2014 Jun 19;10(6):e1004440;PLoS Genet. 2017 Feb 17;13(2):e1006629;J Bacteriol. 2011 Oct;193(19):5510-3;J Bacteriol. 2016 Aug 25;198(18):2458-69;Anal Biochem. 1968 Sep;24(3):470-81;J Bacteriol. 2016 Oct 7;198(21):3000-3015;RNA Biol. 2012 Apr;9(4):379-91;Front Microbiol. 2016 Feb 26;7:179;PLoS Pathog. 2012;8(11):e1003052;Curr Issues Mol Biol. 2012;14(2):47-70;Environ Microbiol. 2014 Mar;16(3):676-88;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Aug 1;103(31):11653-8;J Bacteriol. 1995 May;177(10):2663-72;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Jul 18;114(29):7707-7712;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2007 Dec;10(6):644-8;J Bacteriol. 2003 Aug;185(15):4450-60;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2009 Sep;7(9):654-65;J Bacteriol. 2007 May;189(9):3547-55;Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2007 Sep;14(9):807-13;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Dec 11;109(50):20632-6;Microbiology. 2000 Oct;146 ( Pt 10):2395-407;Microbiol Rev. 1996 Sep;60(3):539-74;EMBO J. 2016 May 2;35(9):991-1011;J Bacteriol. 2018 May 9;200(11):;Cell Mol Life Sci. 2010 Sep;67(17):2897-908;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Nov;50(4):1361-79;Mol Microbiol. 2009 May;72(3):612-32;J Biol Chem. 2009 Dec 11;284(50):34976-85;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jan;187(1):276-85;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 8;100(14):8484-9;F1000Res. 2017 Jul 28;6:1261;Dev Cell. 2004 Nov;7(5):745-54;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Sep 10;110(37):15055-60;Bioinformatics. 2000 Oct;16(10):944-5;Science. 1999 Aug 6;285(5429):901-6;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Sep 15;90(18):8377-81;J Bacteriol. 2001 Sep;183(18):5395-401;Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jan;41(Database issue):D991-5;J Bacteriol. 2007 Nov;189(22):8165-78;Mol Microbiol. 2010 Oct;78(1):158-72;MBio. 2010 Oct 19;1(4):null;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2010 Mar;76(5):1497-506;J Bacteriol. 2005 May;187(10):3496-501;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2009 Mar;33(2):279-94;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Dec 22;106(51):21866-71;Nat Genet. 2000 Apr;24(4):355-61;Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):1913-28;J Bacteriol. 2004 May;186(10):2936-45;Environ Microbiol. 2011 Mar;13(3):666-83;Nat Genet. 2002 Sep;32(1):191-4;Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jan 7;41(1):1-20;J Vis Exp. 2013 Mar 20;(73):e50103;Microbiology. 2006 Feb;152(Pt 2):405-18;Microbiol Res. 2015 Mar;172:19-25;Environ Microbiol. 2011 Dec;13(12):3128-38;PLoS Pathog. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000354;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Sep 8;112(36):11353-8;J Bacteriol. 2016 Jun 13;198(13):1812-1826;Infect Immun. 2006 May;74(5):3012-5;J Bacteriol. 2014 Aug;196(15):2827-41;PLoS Pathog. 2009 Nov;5(11):e1000668;BMC Microbiol. 2016 Jul 19;16(1):155	MEDLINE	ppublish

ParA and ParB homologs are involved in accurate chromosome segregation in bacteria. ParBs participate in the separation of ori domains by binding to parS palindromes, mainly localized close to oriC. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa neither ParB deficiency nor modification of all 10 parSs is lethal. However, such mutants show not only defects in chromosome segregation but also growth retardation and motility dysfunctions. Moreover, a lack of parB alters expression of over 1000 genes, suggesting that ParB could interact with the chromosome outside its canonical parS targets. Here, we show that indeed ParB binds specifically to hundreds of sites in the genome. ChIP-seq analysis revealed 420 ParB-associated regions in wild-type strain and around 1000 in a ParB-overproducing strain and in various parS mutants. The vast majority of the ParB-enriched loci contained a heptanucleotide motif corresponding to one arm of the parS palindrome. All previously postulated parSs, except parS5, interacted with ParB in vivo. Whereas the ParB binding to the four parS sites closest to oriC, parS1-4, is involved in chromosome segregation, its genome-wide interactions with hundreds of parS half-sites could affect chromosome topology, compaction and gene expression, thus allowing P. aeruginosa ParB to be classified as a nucleoid-associated protein.	46	9	4592-4606	10.1093/nar/gky257	Kawalek;Bartosik;Glabski;Jagura-Burdzy	Adam;Aneta A;Krzysztof;Grazyna	Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Department of Microbial Biochemistry, Pawinskiego 5a, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.;Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Department of Microbial Biochemistry, Pawinskiego 5a, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.;Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Department of Microbial Biochemistry, Pawinskiego 5a, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.;Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Department of Microbial Biochemistry, Pawinskiego 5a, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.	eng	J Bacteriol. 2011 Jul;193(13):3342-55;Cell. 2008 Oct 3;135(1):74-84;J Bacteriol. 1994 Sep;176(17):5320-9;Mol Microbiol. 1990 Sep;4(9):1455-63;Open Biol. 2016 Apr;6(4):150263;Methods Mol Biol. 2014;1149:591-605;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Nov;42(3):741-55;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Dec 19;97(26):14656-61;PLoS One. 2015 Mar 20;10(3):e0120867;J Bacteriol. 2011 Apr;193(7):1504-14;Cell. 1997 Mar 7;88(5):675-84;MBio. 2014 May 06;5(3):e01061-14;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2004 Dec;7(6):572-8;Cell. 2009 May 15;137(4):685-96;Nucleic Acids Res. 2017 Jul 7;45(12 ):7106-7117;Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol. 2015 ;31:171-99;PLoS Genet. 2016 Nov 7;12 (11):e1006428;Mol Microbiol. 2000 Aug;37(3):455-66;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Oct 7;105(40):15435-40;Mol Microbiol. 2007 May;64(3):703-18;Mol Microbiol. 2013 Mar;87(5):998-1012;J Bacteriol. 2010 Feb;192(4):1113-21;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jun 17;111(24):8809-14;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Aug;41(3):743-55;Gene. 1998 Sep 14;217(1-2):83-90;Nat Cell Biol. 2010 Aug;12(8):791-8;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Bioinformatics. 2011 Jun 15;27(12):1696-7;J Bacteriol. 2004 Oct;186(20):6983-98;Cell. 2010 Jun 11;141(6):927-42;Mol Microbiol. 2006 May;60(4):853-69;Front Mol Biosci. 2016 Aug 29;3:44;Mol Microbiol. 2011 Feb;79(4):1089-100;Microbiology. 2012 May;158(Pt 5):1183-95;J Bacteriol. 2007 Dec;189(23):8693-703;Brief Bioinform. 2013 Mar;14(2):178-92;J Biol Chem. 1994 Nov 25;269(47):29908-13;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2010 Mar;8(3):185-95;PLoS One. 2017 Jul 21;12 (7):e0181726;Science. 2017 Feb 3;355(6324):524-527;Curr Protoc Microbiol. 2012 Feb;Chapter 1:Unit1F.1;Microbiology. 2009 Apr;155(Pt 4):1080-92;Elife. 2014 May 23;3:e02758;Cell Rep. 2017 Aug 29;20(9):2057-2071;PLoS Genet. 2013 Jun;9(6):e1003579;Genes Dev. 2006 Dec 1;20(23):3269-82;Genes Dev. 2014 Jun 1;28(11):1228-38;Nucleic Acids Res. 2016 Jul 8;44(W1):W160-5;Genome Biol. 2008;9(9):R137;Biochem Soc Trans. 2013 Apr;41(2):542-7;Nature. 2012 Jan 04;481(7381):389-93;PLoS One. 2014 Jan 31;9(1):e87276;Mol Microbiol. 2011 Aug;81(3):676-88;Nucleic Acids Res. 2016 Jul 8;44(W1):W3-W10;Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2016 Jun;40:60-65;Mol Microbiol. 1992 Mar;6(5):629-34;Mol Microbiol. 1996 Aug;21(3):501-9;Trends Genet. 2015 Mar;31(3):164-73;Bioinformatics. 2014 Oct;30(19):2808-10;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Feb;51(4):973-85;Genome Biol. 2009;10(3):R25;Mol Microbiol. 1999 May;32(3):519-32;J Bacteriol. 2010 Jul;192(13):3441-51;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Mar;47(5):1225-37;PLoS Genet. 2013 May;9(5):e1003492;PLoS One. 2017 May 31;12 (5):e0177056;J Bacteriol. 2007 Aug;189(15):5762-72;J Gen Microbiol. 1992 Jan;138(1):1-16;Mol Microbiol. 1999 Oct;34(2):205-16;Cell. 1998 Mar 6;92(5):675-85;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Feb 15;30(4):1046-55;Cell. 2009 May 15;137(4):697-707;Nucleic Acids Res. 2015 Jan;43(2):719-31;Nucleic Acids Res. 2018 Feb 16;46(3):1196-1209;Elife. 2017 Dec 15;6:null;Cell Syst. 2015 Aug 26;1(2):163-73;Genes Dev. 2015 Aug 1;29(15):1661-75;MBio. 2015 Jun 30;6(4):e00662;Mol Microbiol. 1997 Sep;25(5):945-54;J Bacteriol. 2000 Mar;182(5):1313-20;PLoS One. 2014 Jan 22;9(1):e86897;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Sep;45(5):1365-77;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2016 Apr 04;82(8):2320-2335;Mol Microbiol. 2000 Aug;37(3):528-41;Acta Biochim Pol. 2005;52(1):1-34;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Sep;61(5):1352-61	MEDLINE	ppublish

RNAs are well-suited to act as cellular sensors that detect and respond to metabolite changes in the environment, due to their ability to fold into complex structures. Here, we introduce a genome-wide strategy called PARCEL that experimentally identifies RNA aptamers in vitro, in a high-throughput manner. By applying PARCEL to a collection of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, we have revealed 58 new RNA aptamers to three key metabolites, greatly expanding the list of natural RNA aptamers. The newly identified RNA aptamers exhibit significant sequence conservation, are highly structured and show an unexpected prevalence in coding regions. We identified a prokaryotic precursor tmRNA that binds vitamin B2 (FMN) to facilitate its maturation, as well as eukaryotic mRNAs that bind and respond to FMN, suggesting FMN as the second RNA-binding ligand to affect eukaryotic expression. PARCEL results show that RNA-based sensing and gene regulation is more widespread than previously appreciated in different organisms.	9	1	1289	10.1038/s41467-018-03675-1	Tapsin;Sun;Shen;Zhang;Lim;Susanto;Yang;Zeng;Lee;Lezhava;Ang;Zhang;Wang;Zhao;Nagarajan;Wan	Sidika;Miao;Yang;Huibin;Xin Ni;Teodorus Theo;Siwy Ling;Gui Sheng;Jasmine;Alexander;Ee Lui;Lian Hui;Yue;Huimin;Niranjan;Yue	Stem Cell and Development Biology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, 138672, Singapore.;Computational and Systems Biology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, 138672, Singapore.;Computational and Systems Biology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, 138672, Singapore.;Metabolic Engineering Research Laboratory (MERL), Science and Engineering Institutes, Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A*STAR), 31 Biopolis Way, Nanos #01-01, Singapore, 138669, Singapore.;Stem Cell and Development Biology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, 138672, Singapore.;Stem Cell and Development Biology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, 138672, Singapore.;Stem Cell and Development Biology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, 138672, Singapore.;Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Proteos, 61 Biopolis Drive, Singapore, 138673, Singapore.;Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Proteos, 61 Biopolis Drive, Singapore, 138673, Singapore.;Translational research group, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, 138672, Singapore.;Metabolic Engineering Research Laboratory (MERL), Science and Engineering Institutes, Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A*STAR), 31 Biopolis Way, Nanos #01-01, Singapore, 138669, Singapore.;Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Proteos, 61 Biopolis Drive, Singapore, 138673, Singapore.;Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Proteos, 61 Biopolis Drive, Singapore, 138673, Singapore.;Metabolic Engineering Research Laboratory (MERL), Science and Engineering Institutes, Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A*STAR), 31 Biopolis Way, Nanos #01-01, Singapore, 138669, Singapore.;Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, 61801, United States.;Computational and Systems Biology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, 138672, Singapore. nagarajann@gis.a-star.edu.sg.;Stem Cell and Development Biology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, 138672, Singapore. wany@gis.a-star.edu.sg.	eng	Genome Res. 2010 Oct;20(10):1451-8;Nature. 2002 Oct 31;419(6910):952-6;Nat Methods. 2012 Mar 04;9(4):357-9;Bioinformatics. 2010 Jan 1;26(1):139-40;RNA. 2005 Mar;11(3):344-54;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Mar;87(6):2264-8;J Vis Exp. 2013 Dec 30;(82):50948;Plant Cell. 2007 Nov;19(11):3437-50;Algorithms Mol Biol. 2011 Nov 24;6:26;J Mol Biol. 2004 Sep 3;342(1):19-30;Genome Biol. 2007;8(11):R239;Mol Biol Cell. 2000 Dec;11(12):4241-57;Science. 2008 Jun 6;320(5881):1344-9;Methods Mol Biol. 2008;419:53-67;Bioinformatics. 2011 Aug 1;27(15):2141-3;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Mar 19;32(5):1792-7;Nat Rev Genet. 2011 Aug 18;12(9):641-55;Science. 2016 Apr 8;352(6282):aad9822;Nat Genet. 2008 Mar;40(3):351-5;Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Mar 1;41(5):3022-31;Nat Struct Biol. 2003 Sep;10(9):701-7;Nucleic Acids Res. 1996 Jul 1;24(13):2519-24;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Dec 10;99(25):15908-13;Mol Biol Evol. 2004 Dec;21(12):2290-8;J Mol Biol. 2004 Aug 20;341(4):1085-96;Nat Methods. 2012 Jun 28;9(7):676-82;J Mol Evol. 1980 Dec;16(2):111-20;BMC Genomics. 2013 Nov 01;14:745;Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2012 Feb 01;4(2):null;Nature. 2010 Sep 2;467(7311):103-7;Mol Divers. 1995 Sep;1(1):69-78;PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e22594;Curr Protoc Mol Biol. 2001 May;Chapter 13:Unit13.12;Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2006 Nov;4(4):259-63	MEDLINE	epublish

The Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is found in several habitats, both natural and human-made, and is particularly known for its recurrent presence as a pathogen in the lungs of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease. Given its clinical importance, several major studies have investigated the genomic adaptation of P. aeruginosa in lungs and its transition as acute infections become chronic. However, our knowledge about the diversity and adaptation of the P. aeruginosa genome to non-clinical environments is still fragmentary, in part due to the lack of accurate reference genomes of strains from the numerous environments colonized by the bacterium. Here, we used PacBio long-read technology to sequence the genome of PPF-1, a strain of P. aeruginosa isolated from a dental unit waterline. Generating this closed genome was an opportunity to investigate genomic features that are difficult to accurately study in a draft genome (contigs state). It was possible to shed light on putative genomic islands, some shared with other reference genomes, new prophages, and the complete content of insertion sequences. In addition, four different group II introns were also found, including two characterized here and not listed in the specialized group II intron database.	61	5	359-365	10.1139/gen-2017-0239	Vincent;Charette;Barbeau	Antony T;Steve J;Jean	a Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada.;b Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (CRIUCPQ), Quebec City, QC, Canada.;c Département de biochimie, de microbiologie et de bio-informatique, Université Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada.;a Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada.;b Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (CRIUCPQ), Quebec City, QC, Canada.;c Département de biochimie, de microbiologie et de bio-informatique, Université Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada.;d Département de stomatologie, Faculté de médecine dentaire, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Microbiol.	1365-2672	Genome characterization of piscine 'Scale drop and Muscle Necrosis syndrome'-associated strain of Vibrio harveyi focusing on bacterial virulence determinants.	Genomic characterization of Harveyi clade vibrio strain Y6 causing 'Scale drop and Muscle Necrosis syndrome' (SDMN) isolated from barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in Vietnam.;A bacterial genome was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform. Multilocus sequence analysis confirmed that the bacterium belongs to Vibrio harveyi species. Further phylogenetic analysis inferred from core genome SNPs revealed a close relationship between our bacterium and the V. harveyi isolated from groupers in Taiwan and China. blastp results indicated that V. harveyi piscine strains carried numerous adhesin, secretion system, siderophore and toxin-related genes. Genome comparison between Y6 and 32 strains of V. harveyi from different origins showed that at least 17 potential virulence genes were present exclusively in the strain Y6. Many of these (six of 17 genes) were homologous to pyoverdine siderophore, a secreted high-affinity iron chelator, clusters originally found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Genome of V. harveyi Y6 was incorporated by a bacteriophage VHY6φ and replication protein of the phage was most similar to CTXφ described previously in Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio fischeri. However, the cholera toxin-encoding genes, namely ctxA and ctxB, were absent from VHY6φ, while the CTXφ-enterotoxin gene (zonula occludens toxin; zot) remained intact.;Several putative virulence genes and a phage carrying toxin gene were identified in the genomes of SDMN-associated V. harveyi Y6.;This study confers genomic information of the piscine pathogenic V. harveyi which recently caused widespread mortality. Such information is of importance to gain insight into bacterial molecular pathogenesis.	124	3	652-666	10.1111/jam.13676	Kayansamruaj;Dong;Hirono;Kondo;Senapin;Rodkhum	P;H T;I;H;S;C	Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.;Department of Aquaculture, Faculty of Fisheries, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand.;Aquaculture Vaccine Platform, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand.;Laboratory of Genome Science, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, Tokyo, Japan.;Laboratory of Genome Science, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, Tokyo, Japan.;Center of Excellence for Shrimp Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (Centex Shrimp), Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.;National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC), National Science and Technology Development Agency, Pathumthani, Thailand.;Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.;Fish Infectious Diseases (FIDs) - Special Task Force for Activating Research (STAR), Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Nature communications	Nat Commun	2041-1723	Strain-resolved analysis of hospital rooms and infants reveals overlap between the human and room microbiome.	Preterm infants exhibit different microbiome colonization patterns relative to full-term infants, and it is speculated that the hospital room environment may contribute to infant microbiome development. Here, we present a genome-resolved metagenomic study of microbial genotypes from the gastrointestinal tracts of infants and from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) room environment. Some strains detected in hospitalized infants also occur in sinks and on surfaces, and belong to species such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are frequently implicated in nosocomial infection and preterm infant gut colonization. Of the 15 K. pneumoniae strains detected in the study, four were detected in both infant gut and room samples. Time series experiments showed that nearly all strains associated with infant gut colonization can be detected in the room after, and often before, detection in the gut. Thus, we conclude that a component of premature infant gut colonization is the cycle of microbial exchange between the room and the occupant.	8	1	1814	10.1038/s41467-017-02018-w	Brooks;Olm;Firek;Baker;Thomas;Morowitz;Banfield	Brandon;Matthew R;Brian A;Robyn;Brian C;Michael J;Jillian F	Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.;Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.;Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, USA.;Division of Newborn Medicine, Magee-Womens Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, Pittsburgh, PA, 15224, USA.;Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.;Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, USA.;Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA. jbanfield@berkeley.edu.	eng	Bioinformatics. 2016 Feb 15;32(4):605-7;Microbiome. 2015 Dec 01;3:59;Indoor Air. 2011 Dec;21(6):521-30;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Apr;42(8):e67;Nat Methods. 2012 Mar 04;9(4):357-9;Microbiome. 2014 Jan 28;2(1):1;Microbiome. 2014 Oct 13;2:38;Nature. 2015 Jul 9;523(7559):208-11;Bioinformatics. 2012 Jun 1;28(11):1420-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Genome Res. 2017 Apr;27(4):601-612;ISME J. 2016 Dec;10 (12 ):2817-2830;BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 Mar 08;11:119;Front Microbiol. 2016 Apr 20;7:459;Nucleic Acids Res. 2015 Aug 18;43(14):6761-71;Bioinformatics. 2010 Oct 1;26(19):2460-1;ISME J. 2017 Dec;11(12 ):2864-2868;Bioinformatics. 2007 May 15;23(10):1282-8;Elife. 2015 Mar 03;4:null;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2010 Mar;8(3):207-17;Nat Methods. 2014 Nov;11(11):1144-6;Bioinformatics. 2013 Nov 15;29(22):2933-5;PLoS One. 2016 May 13;11(5):e0154991;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jan;42(Database issue):D199-205	MEDLINE	epublish

Diketopiperazines (DKPs) make up a large group of natural products with diverse structures and biological activities. Bicyclomycin is a broad-spectrum DKP antibiotic with unique structure and function: it contains a highly oxidized bicyclic [4.2.2] ring and is the only known selective inhibitor of the bacterial transcription termination factor, Rho. Here, we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster for bicyclomycin containing six iron-dependent oxidases.

59	28934400	2017	09	01		Print	Journal Article	FEMS microbiology ecology	FEMS Microbiol. Ecol.	1574-6941	Genomic characterisation of environmental Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from dental unit waterlines revealed the insertion sequence ISPa11 as a chaotropic element.	The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is well known to have a remarkable adaptive capacity allowing it to colonise many environments. A recent study on environmental isolates from dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) hinted at a genetic clustering into two groups. Isolates from one of these groups, named cluster III, were shown to have unusual phenotypes for environmental isolates, such as an increased biofilm production. To have a better ecological view, more specifically on isolates from cluster III, the complete genomes of 39 isolates including 16 from DUWLs were sequenced. In addition to an investigation of antibiotic resistance and secretion system gene content, a molecular phylogeny allowed confirmation of the split of the 16 environmental isolates in two groups and also sheds light on a correlation between the phylogenetic positions and the serotypes of the isolates. Isolates from cluster III harboured insertion sequences ISPa11 inserted into the O-specific antigen biosynthesis clusters and the gene lasR, encoding for a master regulator of the quorum sensing. Investigation of key regulators revealed another truncated gene, gacS. Alteration in lasR and gacS genes was consistent with phenotypic assays confirming their inactivation. These results bring new perspectives regarding the ecological adaptive potential of P. aeruginosa.	93	9		10.1093/femsec/fix106	Vincent;Freschi;Jeukens;Kukavica-Ibrulj;Emond-Rheault;Leduc;Boyle;Jean-Pierre;Groleau;Déziel;Barbeau;Charette;Levesque	Antony T;Luca;Julie;Irena;Jean-Guillaume;Annie;Brian;Fabrice;Marie-Christine;Eric;Jean;Steve J;Roger C	Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Université Laval, Quebec City G1V 0A6, Canada.;Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (CRIUCPQ), 2725 Chemin Ste-Foy, Quebec City G1V 4G5, Canada.;Département de biochimie, de microbiologie et de bio-informatique, 1045 avenue de la Médecine, Université Laval, Quebec City G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Université Laval, Quebec City G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Université Laval, Quebec City G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Université Laval, Quebec City G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Université Laval, Quebec City G1V 0A6, Canada.;Département de stomatologie, Faculté de Médecine Dentaire, Université de Montréal, 2900 Edouard-Montpetit, Montreal H3C 3J7, Canada.;Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Université Laval, Quebec City G1V 0A6, Canada.;INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, 531 Boul. des Prairies, Laval, Québec H7V1B7, Canada.;INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, 531 Boul. des Prairies, Laval, Québec H7V1B7, Canada.;INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, 531 Boul. des Prairies, Laval, Québec H7V1B7, Canada.;Département de stomatologie, Faculté de Médecine Dentaire, Université de Montréal, 2900 Edouard-Montpetit, Montreal H3C 3J7, Canada.;Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Université Laval, Quebec City G1V 0A6, Canada.;Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (CRIUCPQ), 2725 Chemin Ste-Foy, Quebec City G1V 4G5, Canada.;Département de biochimie, de microbiologie et de bio-informatique, 1045 avenue de la Médecine, Université Laval, Quebec City G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Université Laval, Quebec City G1V 0A6, Canada.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Lett.	1574-6968	Comparative genomics of a drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa panel and the challenges of antimicrobial resistance prediction from genomes.	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is now recognized as a global threat to human health. The accessibility of microbial whole-genome sequencing offers an invaluable opportunity for resistance surveillance via the resistome, i.e. the genes and mutations underlying AMR. Unfortunately, AMR prediction from genomic data remains extremely challenging, especially for species with a large pan-genome. One such organism, for which multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates are frequently encountered in the clinic, is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study focuses on a commercially available panel of seven MDR P. aeruginosa strains. The main goals were to sequence and compare these strains' genomes, attempt to predict AMR from whole genomes using two different methods and determine whether this panel could be an informative complement to the international P. aeruginosa reference panel. As expected, the results highlight the complexity of associating genotype and AMR phenotype in P. aeruginosa, mainly due to the intricate regulation of resistance mechanisms. Our results also urge caution in the interpretation of predicted resistomes regarding the occurrence of gene identity discrepancies between strains. We envision that, in addition to accounting for the genomic diversity of P. aeruginosa, future development of predictive tools will need to incorporate a transcriptomic, proteomic and/or metabolomic component.	364	18		10.1093/femsle/fnx161	Jeukens;Kukavica-Ibrulj;Emond-Rheault;Freschi;Levesque	J;I;J G;L;R C	Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes, Université Laval, Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Québec G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes, Université Laval, Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Québec G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes, Université Laval, Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Québec G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes, Université Laval, Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Québec G1V 0A6, Canada.;Institut de Biologie Intégrative et des Systèmes, Université Laval, Pavillon Charles-Eugène-Marchand, 1030 avenue de la Médecine, Québec G1V 0A6, Canada.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Microbiol.	1480-3275	MexXY efflux pump overexpression and aminoglycoside resistance in cystic fibrosis isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from chronic infections.	In this study, we analyzed 15 multidrug-resistant cystic fibrosis isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from chronic lung infections for expression of 4 different multidrug efflux systems (MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN, and MexXY), using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Overexpression of MexXY pump was observed in all of the isolates tested. Analysis of regulatory genes that control the expression of these 4 efflux pumps revealed a number of previously uncharacterized mutations. Our work shows that MexXY pump overexpression is common in cystic fibrosis isolates and could be contributing to their reduced aminoglycoside susceptibility. Further, we also identified novel mutations in the regulatory genes of the 4 abovementioned Resistance-Nodulation-Division superfamily pumps that may be involved in the overexpression of these pumps.	63	12	929-938	10.1139/cjm-2017-0380	Singh;Yau;Wang;Waters;Kumar	Manu;Yvonne C W;Shirley;Valerie;Ayush	a Department of Microbiology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.;b Division of Microbiology, Department of Paediatric Laboratory Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.;a Department of Microbiology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.;c Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.;a Department of Microbiology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.;d Manitoba Chemosensory Biology Group, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Microbiol.	1365-2958	Nudix-type RNA pyrophosphohydrolase provides homeostasis of virulence factor pyocyanin and functions as a global regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	The PA0336 protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa belongs to the family of widely distributed Nudix pyrophosphohydrolases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate bonds in a variety of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. The amino acid sequence of the PA0336 protein is highly similar to that of the RppH Nudix RNA pyrophosphohydrolase from Escherichia coli, which removes pyrophosphate from 5'-end of triphosphorylated RNA transcripts. Trans-complementation experiments showed that the P. aeruginosa enzyme can functionally substitute for RppH in E. coli cells indicating that, similar to RppH, the Pseudomonas hydrolase mediates RNA turnover in vivo. In order to elucidate the biological significance of the PA0336 protein in Pseudomonas cells, a PA0336 mutant strain was constructed. The mutated strain considerably increased level of the virulence factor pyocyanin compared to wild type, suggesting that PA0336 could be involved in downregulation of P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. This phenotype was reversed by complementation with the wild type but not catalytically inactive PA0336, indicating that the catalytic activity was indispensable for its biological function. Pathogenesis tests in Caenorhabditis elegans showed that the PA0336 mutant of P. aeruginosa was significantly more virulent than the parental strain, confirming further that the P. aeruginosa RNA pyrophosphohydrolase PA0336 modulates bacterial pathogenesis by down-regulating production of virulence-associated factors. To study the role of PA0336 further, transcriptomes of the PA0336 mutant and the wild-type strain were compared using RNA sequencing. The level of 537 transcripts coding for proteins involved in a variety of cellular processes such as replication, transcription, translation, central metabolism and pathogenesis, was affected by the lack of PA0336. These results indicate that the PA0336 RNA pyrophosphohydrolase functions as a global regulator that influences many of transcripts including those involved in P. aeruginosa virulence.	106	3	381-394	10.1111/mmi.13771	Kujawa;Lirski;Ziecina;Drabinska;Modzelan;Kraszewska	Martyna;Maciej;Mateusz;Joanna;Marta;Elzbieta	Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS, Pawińskiego 5A, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.;Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS, Pawińskiego 5A, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.;Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS, Pawińskiego 5A, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.;Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS, Pawińskiego 5A, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.;Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS, Pawińskiego 5A, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.;Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS, Pawińskiego 5A, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

The ability of bacteriophages to kill bacteria is well known, as is their potential use as alternatives to antibiotics. As such, bacteriophages reach high doses locally through infection of their bacterial host in the human body. In this study we assessed the gene expression profile of peripheral blood monocytes from six donors for twelve immunity-related genes (i.e. CD14, CXCL1, CXCL5, IL1A, IL1B, IL1RN, IL6, IL10, LYZ, SOCS3, TGFBI and TNFA) induced by Staphylococcus aureus phage ISP and four Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages (i.e. PNM, LUZ19, 14-1 and GE-vB_Pae-Kakheti25). The phages were able to induce clear and reproducible immune responses. Moreover, the overall immune response was very comparable for all five phages: down-regulation of LYZ and TGFBI, and up-regulation of CXCL1, CXCL5, IL1A, IL1B, IL1RN, IL6, SOCS3 and TNFA. The observed immune response was shown to be endotoxin-independent and predominantly anti-inflammatory. Addition of endotoxins to the highly purified phages did not cause an immune response comparable to the one induced by the (endotoxin containing) phage lysate. In addition, the use of an intermediate level of endotoxins tipped the immune response to a more anti-inflammatory response, i.e. up-regulation of IL1RN and a strongly reduced expression of CXCL1 and CXCL5.	7	1	8004	10.1038/s41598-017-08336-9	Van Belleghem;Clement;Merabishvili;Lavigne;Vaneechoutte	Jonas D;Frédéric;Maya;Rob;Mario	Laboratory Bacteriology Research, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University Ghent, Medical Research Building II, De Pintelaan 185, 9000, Ghent, Belgium. van.belleghem.jonas@gmail.com.;Center for Vaccinology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.;Laboratory Bacteriology Research, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University Ghent, Medical Research Building II, De Pintelaan 185, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.;Laboratory for Molecular and Cellular Technology (LabMCT) Queen Astrid Military Hospital, Bruynstraat 1, 1120, Brussels, Belgium.;Laboratory of Gene Technology, KULeuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 21 box 2462, 3001, Leuven, Belgium.;Laboratory Bacteriology Research, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University Ghent, Medical Research Building II, De Pintelaan 185, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.	eng	Nat Biotechnol. 2004 Jan;22(1):31-6;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Jun 25;110(26):10771-6;Bioinformatics. 2009 Aug 1;25(15):1966-7;Methods. 2001 Dec;25(4):386-401;Viruses. 2015 Aug 20;7(8):4783-99;Curr Opin Immunol. 2012 Aug;24(4):405-10;Nat Immunol. 2001 Apr;2(4):361-7;J Immunol. 2002 Apr 1;168(7):3181-7;ISME J. 2012 May;6(5):915-26;Med Microbiol Immunol. 2006 Sep;195(3):143-50;Genome Biol. 2002 Jun 18;3(7):RESEARCH0034;PLoS One. 2013 Aug 16;8(8):e71036;J Microbiol Methods. 2017 Jan;132:153-159;J Virol Methods. 2004 Mar 15;116(2):177-80;Immunology. 1989 Oct;68(2):233-9;Nat Methods. 2008 Jul;5(7):621-8;J Microbiol Methods. 2009 May;77(2):207-13;Med Immunol. 2003 Feb 14;2(1):2;JAMA. 1967 Feb 20;199(8):519-24;Am J Pathol. 1991 May;138(5):1097-101;Bioinformatics. 2004 Nov 22;20(17):3246-8;Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2006 Nov;47(11):4910-6;Placenta. 2009 Jan;30(1):11-4;BMC Bioinformatics. 2016 Jan 13;17:30;PLoS One. 2009;4(3):e4944;Nat Immunol. 2012 Jul 19;13(8):717-9;Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2000;48(1):31-7;Cell. 1999 Sep 3;98 (5):609-16;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 May 17;102(20):7163-8;Immunity. 1999 Oct;11(4):443-51;Gut Microbes. 2013 Jan-Feb;4(1):4-16;Virus Res. 2008 Feb;131(2):233-42;PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24418;Nat Immunol. 2013 Jul;14(7):654-9;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2874-83;Transplant Proc. 2006 Jan-Feb;38(1):331-3;Mol Immunol. 2002 Dec;39(9):531-6;J Biol Chem. 2006 Mar 10;281(10 ):6316-24;Infect Immun. 2003 Oct;71(10):5803-13;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jan 1;30(1):207-10;Front Microbiol. 2016 Jul 14;7:1112;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2013 Sep;11(9):596;Genome Biol. 2009;10(3):R25;Drug Discov Today. 2009 Jun;14(11-12):536-40;Nature. 2010 Jul 15;466(7304):334-8;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2012 Jun;94(6):1609-17;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2014 May;98(10):4653-61;Nat Immunol. 2003 Jun;4(6):546-50;Annu Rev Immunol. 2011;29:71-109;Anal Biochem. 1988 Feb 1;168(2):324-31;Bacteriophage. 2014 Jan 1;4(1):e28281;Nat Immunol. 2004 Jul;5(7):685-92;Cell Res. 2012 May;22(5):806-21;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Nov 3;112(44):13675-80;Nature. 2005 Sep 15;437(7057):356-61;Clin Exp Med. 2009 Jun;9(2):93-100;J Immunol. 2008 May 1;180(9):5771-7;Eur J Pharm Biopharm. 2008 Oct;70(2):577-81;J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2006 Dec;26(12):893-900;Genome Res. 2011 Oct;21(10):1616-25;J Virol. 2014 Nov;88(21):12551-7;Infect Immun. 2004 Aug;72(8):4416-23;Cell. 1999 Sep 3;98 (5):597-608;Brain Res Rev. 2011 Jun 24;67(1-2):157-83;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2004 May;28(2):127-81;Genome Res. 1997 Oct;7(10):986-95;Nature. 2009 Jan 22;457(7228):480-4	MEDLINE	epublish
64	28797043	2017				Electronic-eCollection	Journal Article	PloS one	PLoS ONE	1932-6203	Next generation sequencing reveals the antibiotic resistant variants in the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	Rapid progress in next generation sequencing and allied computational tools have aided in identification of single nucleotide variants in genomes of several organisms. In the present study, we have investigated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ten multi-antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates. All the draft genomes were submitted to Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) web server and the predicted protein sequences were used for comparison. Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP) found in the clinical isolates compared to the reference genome (PAO1), and the comparison of nsSNPs between antibiotic resistant and susceptible clinical isolates revealed insights into the genome variation. These nsSNPs identified in the multi-drug resistant clinical isolates were found to be altering a single amino acid in several antibiotic resistant genes. We found mutations in genes encoding efflux pump systems, cell wall, DNA replication and genes involved in repair mechanism. In addition, nucleotide deletions in the genome and mutations leading to generation of stop codons were also observed in the antibiotic resistant clinical isolates. Next generation sequencing is a powerful tool to compare the whole genomes and analyse the single base pair variations found within the antibiotic resistant genes. We identified specific mutations within antibiotic resistant genes compared to the susceptible strain of the same bacterial species and these findings may provide insights to understand the role of single nucleotide variants in antibiotic resistance.	12	8	e0182524	10.1371/journal.pone.0182524	Ramanathan;Jindal;Le;Gudimella;Anwar;Razali;Poole-Johnson;Manikam;Sekaran	Babu;Hassan Mahmood;Cheng Foh;Ranganath;Arif;Rozaimi;Johan;Rishya;Shamala Devi	Department of Biological Sciences, School of Science and Technology, Sunway University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Jalan Broga, Selangor, Malaysia.;Sengenics, High Impact Research (HIR), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Sengenics, High Impact Research (HIR), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Sengenics, High Impact Research (HIR), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Sengenics, High Impact Research (HIR), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Department of Trauma and Emergency, University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.	eng	J Antimicrob Chemother. 2005 Jul;56(1):20-51;Cell. 2007 Mar 23;128(6):1037-50;Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2009 Sep;86(3):336-9;Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2000 Oct;19(10):959-63;J Hosp Infect. 2010 May;75(1):37-41;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009 Oct;22(4):582-610;Indian J Med Res. 1997 Dec;106:500-3;Bioinformatics. 2014 Jul 15;30(14):2068-9;J Clin Microbiol. 2007 Nov;45(11):3795-801;Evol Med Public Health. 2016 Jun 14;2016(1):182-94;Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Jan;40(Database issue):D641-5;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2004 May;48(5):1676-80;Nat Rev Genet. 2010 Jan;11(1):31-46;PLoS One. 2014 Oct 15;9(10):e107754;BMC Genomics. 2011 Aug 08;12:402;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006 Jan;50(1):43-8;Euro Surveill. 2013 Oct 17;18(42):null;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2003 Apr;47(4):1371-5;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2009 Jul 15;180(2):138-45;Bioinformatics. 2016 Sep 15;32(18):2847-9;BMC Genomics. 2008 Feb 08;9:75;Antimicrob Resist Infect Control. 2014 Oct 20;3(1):32;PLoS One. 2017 Mar 2;12 (3):e0172882;Infect Immun. 2007 May;75(5):2214-24;Euro Surveill. 2013 Jan 24;18(4):20380;Bioinformatics. 2011 Mar 15;27(6):863-4;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2012 May;18(5):502-8;Genome Biol. 2009;10(3):R25;Genome Med. 2013 Apr 29;5(4):36;Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2002 Jun;3(2):77-98;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2003 Jan;47(1):27-33;Chest. 2011 Apr;139(4):909-919;BMC Genomics. 2014 Apr 28;15:318;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2009 Mar;33(2):279-94;J Med Microbiol. 2013 Jul;62(Pt 7):988-1000;PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e29276;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2010 Aug;16(8):1111-6;J Comput Biol. 2012 May;19(5):455-77;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402	MEDLINE	epublish

Virol.	1465-2099	A carrier state is established in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by phage LeviOr01, a newly isolated ssRNA levivirus.	ssRNA bacteriophages are very abundant but poorly studied, particularly in relation to their effect on bacterial evolution. We isolated a new Pseudomonas aeruginosa levivirus, vB_PaeL_PcyII-10_LeviOr01, from hospital waste water. Its genome comprises 3669 nucleotides and encodes four putative proteins. Following bacterial infection, a carrier state is established in a fraction of the cells, conferring superinfection immunity. Such cells also resist other phages that use type IV pili as a receptor. The carrier population is composed of a mixture of cells producing phage, and susceptible cells that are non-carriers. Carrier cells accumulate phage until they burst, releasing large quantities of virions. The continuous presence of phage favours the emergence of host variants bearing mutations in genes involved in type IV pilus biogenesis, but also in genes affecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis. The establishment of a carrier state in which phage particles are continuously released was previously reported for some dsRNA phages, but has not previously been described for a levivirus. The present results highlight the importance of the carrier state, an association that benefits both phages and bacteria and plays a role in bacterial evolution.	98	8	2181-2189	10.1099/jgv.0.000883	Pourcel;Midoux;Vergnaud;Latino	Christine;Cédric;Gilles;Libera	Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC), CEA, CNRS, Univ.

Bacteria of many species rely on a simple molecule, the intracellular secondary messenger c-di-GMP (Bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate), to make a vital choice: whether to stay in one place and form a biofilm, or to leave it in search of better conditions. The c-di-GMP network has a bow-tie shaped architecture that integrates many signals from the outside world-the input stimuli-into intracellular c-di-GMP levels that then regulate genes for biofilm formation or for swarming motility-the output phenotypes. How does the 'uninformed' process of evolution produce a network with the right input/output association and enable bacteria to make the right choice? Inspired by new data from 28 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and strains evolved in laboratory experiments we propose a mathematical model where the c-di-GMP network is analogous to a machine learning classifier. The analogy immediately suggests a mechanism for learning through evolution: adaptation though incremental changes in c-di-GMP network proteins acquires knowledge from past experiences and enables bacteria to use it to direct future behaviors. Our model clarifies the elusive function of the ubiquitous c-di-GMP network, a key regulator of bacterial social traits associated with virulence. More broadly, the link between evolution and machine learning can help explain how natural selection across fluctuating environments produces networks that enable living organisms to make sophisticated decisions.	13	8	e1005677	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005677	Yan;Deforet;Boyle;Rahman;Liang;Okegbe;Dietrich;Qiu;Xavier	Jinyuan;Maxime;Kerry E;Rayees;Raymond;Chinweike;Lars E P;Weigang;Joao B	Program for Computational and Systems Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States of America.;Program for Computational and Systems Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States of America.;Program for Computational and Systems Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States of America.;Department of Biological Sciences, Hunter College & Graduate Center, CUNY, New York, NY, United States of America.;Department of Biological Sciences, Hunter College & Graduate Center, CUNY, New York, NY, United States of America.;Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America.;Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America.;Department of Biological Sciences, Hunter College & Graduate Center, CUNY, New York, NY, United States of America.;Program for Computational and Systems Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States of America.	eng	PLoS Comput Biol. 2007 Jun;3(6):e116;PLoS Comput Biol. 2015 Jun 23;11(5):e1004279;J Med Microbiol. 2010 May;59(Pt 5):511-20;Nucleic Acids Symp Ser (Oxf). 2009;(53):51-2;Mol Microbiol. 2011 Jan;79(1):166-79;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Aug 25;112(34):10756-61;J Bacteriol. 2015 Nov 09;198(3):448-62;J Stat Softw. 2010;33(1):1-22;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Dec;62(5):1264-77;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;Genome Biol Evol. 2014 Dec 04;7(1):18-34;Trends Ecol Evol. 2016 Feb;31(2):147-57;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jan;42(Database issue):D581-91;J Chem Inf Comput Sci. 2004 Jan-Feb;44(1):1-12;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Nov 12;110(46):18478-83;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2010 Sep;8(9):634-44;Nature. 1997 Jun 26;387(6636):913-7;Mol Microbiol. 2012 Nov;86(3):720-9;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Aug;53(4):1123-34;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2839-44;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Jan 12;113(2):E209-18;PLoS Comput Biol. 2015 Mar 23;11(3):e1004055;Cancer Invest. 1992;10(1):43-59;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Oct 4;102(40):14422-7;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2016 Apr;30:139-46;J Vis Exp. 2011 Jan 30;(47):null;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Aug 10;107(32):14419-24;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;Mol Microbiol. 1998 Oct;30(2):295-304;Cell Rep. 2013 Aug 29;4(4):697-708;Microbiol Spectr. 2015 Apr;3(2):MB-0003-2014;Nat Rev Genet. 2005 Feb;6(2):119-27;Trends Biotechnol. 2004 Sep;22(9):446-50;J Biol Chem. 2016 Jun 10;291(24):12547-55;PLoS Pathog. 2014 Oct 23;10(10):e1004480;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2014 Jun;80(11):3384-93;Contemp Clin Trials. 2013 Nov;36(2):636-41;MBio. 2014 Sep 16;5(5):e01592-14;J Bacteriol. 2012 Jun;194(11):2904-15;Curr Opin Pediatr. 2007 Feb;19(1):83-8;J Bacteriol. 2007 May;189(9):3603-12;PLoS One. 2010 Jan 22;5(1):e8842;Trends Microbiol. 2013 Oct;21(10):508-9;Annu Rev Genet. 2006;40:307-33;MBio. 2010 Oct 19;1(4):null;Bioinformatics. 2010 Aug 1;26(15):1907-9;PLoS Genet. 2013;9(9):e1003741;Methods Mol Biol. 2014;1151:165-88;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2009 Apr;7(4):263-73;Nat Protoc. 2009;4(5):783-8;PLoS Biol. 2016 Jul 18;14 (7):e1002519;Biometrika. 1950 Jun;37(1-2):17-23;Mol Syst Biol. 2006;2:2006.0015;Mol Syst Biol. 2009;5:326	MEDLINE	epublish

Arsenic contamination of drinking water and food threatens the health of hundreds of millions of people worldwide by increasing the risk of numerous diseases. Arsenic exposure has been associated with infectious lung disease in epidemiological studies, but it is not yet understood how ingestion of low levels of arsenic increases susceptibility to bacterial infection. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to examine the effect of arsenic on gene expression in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells and to determine if arsenic altered epithelial cell responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen. Bronchial epithelial cells line the airway surface, providing a physical barrier and serving critical roles in antimicrobial defense and signaling to professional immune cells. We used RNA-seq to define the transcriptional response of HBE cells to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and investigated how arsenic affected HBE gene networks in the presence and absence of the bacterial challenge. Environmentally relevant levels of arsenic significantly changed the expression of genes involved in cellular redox homeostasis and host defense to bacterial infection, and decreased genes that code for secreted antimicrobial factors such as lysozyme. Using pathway analysis, we identified Sox4 and Nrf2-regulated gene networks that are predicted to mediate the arsenic-induced decrease in lysozyme secretion. In addition, we demonstrated that arsenic decreased lysozyme in the airway surface liquid, resulting in reduced lysis of Microccocus luteus. Thus, arsenic alters the expression of genes and proteins in innate host defense pathways, thereby decreasing the ability of the lung epithelium to fight bacterial infection.	331		154-163	10.1016/j.taap.2017.06.010	Goodale;Rayack;Stanton	Britton C;Erica J;Bruce A	Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755, United States.

Lett.	1574-6968	Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing response in the absence of functional LasR and LasI proteins: the case of strain 148, a virulent dolphin isolate.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that presents a complex regulatory network called 'quorum-sensing', which is responsible for the transcription of genes coding for several traits implicated in its pathogenicity. Strain 148 is a dolphin isolate that has been shown to produce quorum-sensing-regulated virulence traits and to be virulent in a mouse model, despite the fact that it contains a 20-kbp deletion that eliminates from the chromosome the lasR gene and the lasI promoter. LasR is a key quorum-sensing transcriptional regulator that, when coupled with the autoinducer 3-oxo-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone (3O-C12-HSL) produced by LasI, activates transcription of genes coding for some virulence-associated traits such as elastase, lasI, rhlI and rhlR. RhlR is also a key quorum-sensing transcriptional regulator that, when interacting with the autoinducer butanoyl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) that is produced by the synthase RhlI, activates the genes involved in the synthesis of some virulence-associated traits, as rhamnolipids and pyocyanin. We describe that in P. aeruginosa 148, the LasR/3O-C12-HSL-independent rhlR transcriptional activation is due to the release of the negative effect of Vfr (a CRP-ortholog) caused by the insertion of an IS element in vfr, and that rhlI transcription is driven from the rhlR promoter, forming the rhlR-I operon.	364	12		10.1093/femsle/fnx119	Morales;González-Valdez;Servín-González;Soberón-Chávez	Estefanía;Abigail;Luis;Gloria	Departamento de Biología Molecular y Biotecnología, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad Universitaria, 04510, México, D.

Among viruses, bacteriophages are a group of special interest due to their capacity of infecting bacteria that are important for biotechnology and human health. Composting is a microbial-driven process in which complex organic matter is converted into humus-like substances. In thermophilic composting, the degradation activity is carried out primarily by bacteria and little is known about the presence and role of bacteriophages in this process.;Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as host, we isolated three new phages from a composting operation at the Sao Paulo Zoo Park (Brazil). One of the isolated phages is similar to Pseudomonas phage Ab18 and belongs to the Siphoviridae YuA-like viral genus. The other two isolated phages are similar to each other and present genomes sharing low similarity with phage genomes in public databases; we therefore hypothesize that they belong to a new genus in the Podoviridae family. Detailed genomic descriptions and comparisons of the three phages are presented, as well as two new clusters of phage genomes in the Viral Orthologous Clusters database of large DNA viruses. We found sequences encoding homing endonucleases that disrupt a putative ribonucleotide reductase gene and an RNA polymerase subunit 2 gene in two of the phages. These findings provide insights about the evolution of two-subunits RNA polymerases and the possible role of homing endonucleases in this process. Infection tests on 30 different strains of bacteria reveal a narrow host range for the three phages, restricted to P. aeruginosa PA14 and three other P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. Biofilm dissolution assays suggest that these phages could be promising antimicrobial agents against P. aeruginosa PA14 infections. Analyses on composting metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data indicate association between abundance variations in both phage and host populations in the environment.;The results about the newly discovered and described phages contribute to the understanding of tailed bacteriophage diversity, evolution, and role in the complex composting environment.	18	1	346	10.1186/s12864-017-3729-z	Amgarten;Martins;Lombardi;Antunes;de Souza;Nicastro;Kitajima;Quaggio;Upton;Setubal;da Silva	Deyvid;Layla Farage;Karen Cristina;Luciana Principal;Ana Paula Silva;Gianlucca Gonçalves;Elliott Watanabe;Ronaldo Bento;Chris;João Carlos;Aline Maria	Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.;Programa de Pós-Graduação Interunidades em Bioinformática, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.;Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.;Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.;Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.;Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.;Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.;Departamento de Fitopatologia e Nematologia, Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz, Universidade de São Paulo, Piracicaba, Brazil.;Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.;Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.;Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. setubal@iq.usp.br.;Biocomplexity Institute of Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA. setubal@iq.usp.br.;Departamento de Bioquímica, Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. almsilva@iq.usp.br.	eng	Nature. 2016 Aug 25;536(7617):425-30;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jan;42(Database issue):D553-9;Arch Virol. 2014 Oct;159(10):2771-5;Crit Rev Microbiol. 2016 Nov;42(6):942-68;J Bacteriol. 2002 Sep;184(18):4952-61;Lett Appl Microbiol. 2007 Sep;45(3):313-7;Virus Res. 2000 Sep;70(1-2):55-64;PLoS One. 2013 Apr 24;8(4):e61928;Q Rev Biophys. 2005 Feb;38(1):49-95;J Bacteriol. 2008 Feb;190(4):1429-35;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2015 Aug;59(8):4974-81;Nat Methods. 2012 Mar 04;9(4):357-9;Mol Biol Evol. 2013 Apr;30(4):772-80;Mol Biol Evol. 2001 May;18(5):691-9;Bioresour Technol. 2015 Jan;175:406-16;PLoS One. 2011 Mar 09;6(3):e17288;Bioinformatics. 2014 Jul 15;30(14):2068-9;Cell. 2003 Apr 18;113(2):141;Bioinformatics. 2002 Nov;18(11):1544-5;Genome Res. 2007 Oct;17(10):1486-95;PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e57271;Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jan;41(Database issue):D348-52;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Apr 10;104(15):6176-81;Can J Microbiol. 1995 Jan;41(1):12-8;PLoS One. 2015 Jun 26;10(6):e0130548;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 May 1;30(9):1935-43;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Feb;51(4):1169-83;Brief Bioinform. 2013 Mar;14(2):178-92;Bioresour Technol. 2014 Jun;162:283-93;Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 Oct 3;374(4):747-51;BMC Evol Biol. 2006 Nov 13;6:94;Microb Inform Exp. 2011 Jun 14;1(1):2;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jan 02;32(1):11-6;Front Microbiol. 2015 Sep 15;6:959;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2003 Oct;6(5):506-11;Trends Microbiol. 2005 Jun;13(6):278-84;BMC Microbiol. 2010 Mar 29;10:94;Virol J. 2014 Jan 27;11:14;BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 Mar 08;11:119;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jul;39(Web Server issue):W29-37;PLoS One. 2013 Nov 21;8(11):e79512;Bioinformatics. 2014 May 1;30(9):1312-3;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;RNA. 2011 Dec;17(12):2063-73;BMC Genomics. 2016 Jan 12;17:45;Curr Opin Virol. 2011 Oct;1(4):298-303;J Vis Exp. 2011 Jan 20;(47):null;Virol J. 2010 Oct 28;7:290;BMC Microbiol. 2016 Jun 17;16(1):111;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2012 Jun;78(12):4510-5;Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Jul;38(Web Server issue):W23-8;BMC Syst Biol. 2011;5 Suppl 2:S15;Genome Res. 2004 Jun;14(6):1147-59;Nature. 1987 Feb 19-25;325(6106):728-30;Sci Rep. 2016 Dec 12;6:38915;Front Microbiol. 2014 Oct 10;5:506;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2004 May;28(2):127-81;Trends Microbiol. 2016 Jun;24(6):440-9;Mol Biol Evol. 2008 Jul;25(7):1307-20;Mol Syst Biol. 2009;5:311;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W451-4;J Ind Microbiol. 1996 Jun;16(6):331-41;Mol Gen Genet. 1999 Dec;262(4-5):659-67;J Bacteriol. 2013 Mar;195(5):941-50	MEDLINE	epublish

The bronchial microbiome of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify differences related to biofilm-forming capacity.;Patient sputum samples from 21 patients were studied.;Statistically significant differences related to biofilm-forming capacity were only found for genera with relative abundances <1%, and Fusobacterium was over-represented when biofilm-forming capacity was high. Genera with relative abundances >50% which increased from baseline were observed in 10/14 exacerbations, but corresponded to Pseudomonas only in three episodes, while other pathogenic genera were identified in seven.;The bronchial microbiome shows differences according with P. aeruginosa biofilm-forming capacity. Pathogenic microorganisms other than P. aeruginosa cause a significant part of the exacerbations in colonized chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.	12		379-392	10.2217/fmb-2016-0127	Garcia-Nuñez;Marti;Puig;Perez-Brocal;Millares;Santos;Ardanuy;Moya;Liñares;Monsó	Marian;Sara;Carmen;Vicente;Laura;Salud;Carmen;Andres;Josefina;Eduard	CIBER de Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERes), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain E-28029.;Department of Respiratory Medicine, Parc Taulí Hospital Universitari.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured from exhaled breath have great promise for the diagnosis of bacterial infections. However, determining human or microbial origin of VOCs detected in breath remains a great challenge. For example, the microbial fermentation product 2,3-butanedione was recently found in the breath of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients; parallel culture-independent metagenomic sequencing of the same samples revealed that Streptococcus and Rothia spp. have the genetic capacity to produce 2,3-butanedione. To investigate whether the genetic capacity found in metagenomes translates to bacterial production of a VOC of interest such as 2,3-butanedione, we fed stable isotopes to three bacterial strains isolated from patients: two gram-positive bacteria, Rothia mucilaginosa and Streptococcus salivarius, and a dominant opportunistic gram-negative pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Culture headspaces were collected and analyzed using a gas chromatographic system to quantify the abundance of VOCs of interest; mass spectroscopy was used to determine whether the stable isotope label had been incorporated. Our results show that R. mucilaginosa and S. salivarius consumed D-Glucose-	11	1	017101	10.1088/1752-7163/aa5833	Phan;Meinardi;Barletta;Blake;Whiteson	Joann;Simone;Barbara;Donald R;Katrine	Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA, United States.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

Bacteriophage vB_PaeP_PAO1_phiC725A (short name phiC725A) was isolated following mitomycin C induction of C7-25, a clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain carrying phiC725A as a prophage. The phiC725A genome sequence shows similarity to F116, a P. aeruginosa podovirus capable of generalized transduction. Likewise, phiC725A is a podovirus with long tail fibers. PhiC725A was able to lysogenize two additional P. aeruginosa strains in which it was maintained both as a prophage and in an episomal state. Investigation by deep sequencing showed that bacterial DNA carried inside phage particles originated predominantly from a 700-800kb region, immediately flanking the attL prophage insertion site, whether the phages were induced from a lysogen or recovered after infection. This indicates that during productive replication, recombination of phage genomes with the bacterial chromosome at the att site occurs occasionally, allowing packaging of adjacent bacterial DNA.	12	1	e0169684	10.1371/journal.pone.0169684	Pourcel;Midoux;Hauck;Vergnaud;Latino	Christine;Cédric;Yolande;Gilles;Libera	Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC), CEA, CNRS, Univ.

Bacteriophages (phages) are widely distributed in the biosphere and play a key role in modulating microbial ecology in the soil, ocean, and humans. Although the role of DNA bacteriophages is well described, the biology of RNA bacteriophages is poorly understood. More than 1900 phage genomes are currently deposited in NCBI, but only 6 dsRNA bacteriophages and 12 ssRNA bacteriophages genome sequences are reported. The 6 dsRNA bacteriophages were isolated from legume samples or lakes with Pseudomonas syringae as the host. Here, we report the first Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage phiYY with a three-segmented dsRNA genome. phiYY was isolated from hospital sewage in China with the clinical P. aeruginosa strain, PAO38, as a host. Moreover, the dsRNA phage phiYY has a broad host range, which infects 99 out of 233 clinical P. aeruginosa strains isolated from four provinces in China. This work presented a detailed characterization of the dsRNA bacteriophage infecting P. aeruginosa.	6		38795	10.1038/srep38795	Yang;Lu;Shen;Zhao;Shen;Tan;Li;Li;Wang;Hu;Le	Yuhui;Shuguang;Wei;Xia;Mengyu;Yinling;Gang;Ming;Jing;Fuquan;Shuai	Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.;Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.;Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.;Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.;Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.;Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.;Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.;Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.;Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.;Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.;Department of Microbiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.	eng	Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2015 Aug;46(2):196-200;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Sep 13;113(37):10400-5;PLoS One. 2014 Nov 19;9(11):e113078;Sci Rep. 2015 Feb 10;5:8365;J Gen Virol. 2015 May;96(Pt 5):1180-9;PLoS One. 2015 Aug 25;10(8):e0137015;PLoS One. 2013 May 13;8(5):e62933;J Biol Chem. 2008 May 2;283(18):12227-31;Genetics. 2007 Jun;176(2):1013-22;PLoS One. 2015 Jun 26;10(6):e0130548;Virology. 2000 Sep 15;275(1):218-24;J Struct Biol. 2010 Sep;171(3):389-96;J Virol. 2015 Aug;89(15):7449-56;J Mol Biol. 1999 Nov 26;294(2):357-72;Biol Direct. 2016 Jan 25;11(1):4;J Virol. 1973 May;11(5):799-805;Biochim Biophys Acta. 2016 Oct;1864(10):1281-91;Biochemistry. 2016 Aug 23;55(33):4614-25;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2016 Jun;363(12):null;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 1999 Mar;63(1):149-60;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2015 Jul;99(14):6021-33;Sci Rep. 2016 Sep 23;6:34067;Adv Virus Res. 2012;83:123-41;J Virol. 1975 Sep;16(3):685-95;Virology. 2000 Jun 20;272(1):218-24;Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2000 Nov;56(Pt 11):1473-5;BMC Microbiol. 2010 Feb 19;10:55;PLoS One. 2013 Jul 09;8(7):e68562;Virology. 2002 Feb 1;293(1):118-24;Photochem Photobiol. 2012 Mar-Apr;88(2):304-10;Acta Cir Bras. 2016 Mar;31(3):206-11;J Cell Biol. 1999 Nov 1;147(3):671-82;PLoS Biol. 2016 Mar 24;14(3):e1002409;Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2013 Sep;11(9):909-15	MEDLINE	epublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses at least three well-defined quorum-sensing (QS) (las, rhl and pqs) systems that control a variety of important functions including virulence. RsaL is a QS repressor that reduces QS signal production and ensures homeostasis by functioning in opposition to LasR. However, its regulatory role in signal homeostasis remains elusive. Here, we conducted a ChIP-seq assay and revealed that RsaL bound to two new targets, the intergenic regions of PA2228/PA2229 and pqsH/cdpR, which are required for PQS synthesis. Deletion of rsaL reduced transcription of pqsH and cdpR, thus decreasing PQS signal production. The ΔrsaL strain exhibited increased pyocyanin production and reduced biofilm formation, which are dependent on CdpR or PqsH activity. In addition, we solved the structure of the RsaL-DNA complex at a 2.4 Å resolution. Although the overall sequence similarity is quite low, RsaL folds into a HTH-like structure, which is conserved among many transcriptional regulators. Complementation results of the rsaL knockout cells with different rsaL mutants further confirmed the critical role of the DNA-binding residues (including Arg20, Gln27, Gln38, Gly35, Ser37 and Ser42) that are essential for DNA binding. Our findings reveal new targets of RsaL and provide insight into the detailed characterization of the RsaL-DNA interaction.	45	2	699-710	10.1093/nar/gkw954	Kang;Gan;Zhao;Kong;Zhang;Zhu;Li;Song;Qin;Liang	Huaping;Jianhua;Jingru;Weina;Jing;Miao;Fan;Yaqin;Jin;Haihua	Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710069, China.;Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China.;Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710069, China.;Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710069, China.;Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China.;Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710069, China.;Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710069, China.;Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710069, China.;Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710069, China.;Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710069, China lianghh@nwu.edu.cn.	eng	FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2009 Dec;301(2):210-7;Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol. 2005;21:319-46;Gene. 1998 May 28;212(1):77-86;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Sep 20;108(38):15763-8;Genes Dev. 1996 Jan 1;10(1):27-36;Methods. 2001 Dec;25(4):402-8;Science. 1998 Apr 10;280(5361):295-8;Bioinformatics. 2009 May 1;25(9):1105-11;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1996;50:727-51;Infect Immun. 1993 Apr;61(4):1180-4;J Bacteriol. 2006 Aug;188(16):6026-33;J Biol Chem. 2011 Jan 21;286(3):2285-96;J Bacteriol. 1994 Jan;176(2):269-75;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2003 Feb;6(1):56-60;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 3;101(5):1339-44;Structure. 2007 Jan;15(1):75-83;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Sep 28;96(20):11229-34;Mol Microbiol. 2011 May;80(4):951-65;J Med Microbiol. 2011 Jan;60(Pt 1):22-34;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Oct;58(2):552-64;Mol Microbiol. 1998 Oct;30(2):295-304;Genome Biol. 2008;9(9):R137;Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2003 Jul;59(Pt 7):1131-7;J Bacteriol. 2006 Jan;188(2):815-9;J Biol Chem. 2007 May 4;282(18):13592-600;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Apr 27;107(17):7916-21;J Bacteriol. 2007 Mar;189(5):1922-30;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014;42(16):10307-20;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Feb 28;92(5):1490-4;Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2004 Jan;60(Pt 1):73-82;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007;35(15):5073-84;PLoS Biol. 2016 Apr 27;14(4):e1002449;Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Jul;38(Web Server issue):W545-9;J Bacteriol. 2008 Sep;190(18):6217-27;J Bacteriol. 2003 Apr;185(7):2066-79;Plasmid. 2000 Jan;43(1):59-72;J Bacteriol. 1993 Aug;175(15):4597-604;Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2004 Dec;60(Pt 12 Pt 1):2126-32;PLoS Pathog. 2012;8(3):e1002621;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Dec;50(5):1477-91;J Bacteriol. 2001 Nov;183(22):6676-83;Cell. 2002 May 17;109(4):421-4;Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Sep;3(9):685-95;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Dec;66(6):1557-65;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Feb 27;98(5):2752-7;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Dec 17;110(51):20765-70	MEDLINE	ppublish

Immun.	1098-5522	The Pathogenic Potential of Proteus mirabilis Is Enhanced by Other Uropathogens during Polymicrobial Urinary Tract Infection.	Urinary catheter use is prevalent in health care settings, and polymicrobial colonization by urease-positive organisms, such as Proteus mirabilis and Providencia stuartii, commonly occurs with long-term catheterization. We previously demonstrated that coinfection with P. mirabilis and P. stuartii increased overall urease activity in vitro and disease severity in a model of urinary tract infection (UTI). In this study, we expanded these findings to a murine model of catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI), delineated the contribution of enhanced urease activity to coinfection pathogenesis, and screened for enhanced urease activity with other common CAUTI pathogens. In the UTI model, mice coinfected with the two species exhibited higher urine pH values, urolithiasis, bacteremia, and more pronounced tissue damage and inflammation compared to the findings for mice infected with a single species, despite having a similar bacterial burden within the urinary tract. The presence of P. stuartii, regardless of urease production by this organism, was sufficient to enhance P. mirabilis urease activity and increase disease severity, and enhanced urease activity was the predominant factor driving tissue damage and the dissemination of both organisms to the bloodstream during coinfection. These findings were largely recapitulated in the CAUTI model. Other uropathogens also enhanced P. mirabilis urease activity in vitro, including recent clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa We therefore conclude that the underlying mechanism of enhanced urease activity may represent a widespread target for limiting the detrimental consequences of polymicrobial catheter colonization, particularly by P. mirabilis and other urease-positive bacteria.	85	2		10.1128/IAI.00808-16	Armbruster;Smith;Johnson;DeOrnellas;Eaton;Yep;Mody;Wu;Mobley	Chelsie E;Sara N;Alexandra O;Valerie;Kathryn A;Alejandra;Lona;Weisheng;Harry L T	Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA chelarmb@umich.edu hmobley@umich.edu.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.;Laboratory Animal Medicine Unit, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.;Biological Sciences Department, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, California, USA.;Division of Geriatric and Palliative Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.;Geriatrics Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.;Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA chelarmb@umich.edu hmobley@umich.edu.	eng	Infect Immun. 2004 May;72(5):2922-38;Kidney Int. 2008 Jul;74(1):81-90;Postgrad Med J. 2013 Jun;89(1052):329-34;Invest Urol. 1976 Mar;13(5):346-50;Infect Dis Clin North Am. 2003 Jun;17(2):227-41;J Urol. 1987 Sep;138(3):632-5;Arch Intern Med. 1984 Aug;144(8):1585-8;Cell. 2014 Jan 30;156(3):456-68;Microbes Infect. 2012 Nov;14(14):1263-70;PLoS Pathog. 2015 Jan 08;11(1):e1004601;Nat Methods. 2013 Jun;10(6):563-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Apr 19;113(16):4494-9;J Mol Biol. 2016 Aug 28;428(17):3355-71;Infect Immun. 1991 Oct;59(10):3360-5;Am J Infect Control. 2014 Jan;42(1):17-22;J Exp Med. 2000 Sep 18;192(6):881-90;J Med Microbiol. 2007 Nov;56(Pt 11):1549-57;Infect Immun. 2015 Nov;83(11):4185-93;Microbes Infect. 2000 Oct;2(12):1497-505;Infect Immun. 2009 Dec;77(12):5322-33;Infect Immun. 2005 Jul;73(7):3878-87;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2008 Jan;21(1):26-59;J Infect Dis. 1982 Dec;146(6):719-23;Nat Rev Immunol. 2010 Mar;10 (3):210-5;J Am Geriatr Soc. 1988 Aug;36(8):726-32;BMC Geriatr. 2006 Oct 12;6:15;Curr Protoc Bioinformatics. 2011 Mar;Chapter 11:Unit 11.8;Infect Immun. 2002 Jan;70(1):389-94;Infect Immun. 1983 Apr;40(1):273-83;Drugs Aging. 2005;22(8):627-39;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2012 Nov;10(11):743-54;Immunity. 2015 Apr 21;42(4):744-55;J Infect Dis. 2014 May 15;209(10):1524-32;Scand J Infect Dis. 1994;26(4):361-7;Am J Infect Control. 2015 Mar 1;43(3):206-21;J Infect Dis. 1999 Oct;180(4):1220-9;Infect Immun. 2010 Oct;78(10):4166-75;J Leukoc Biol. 2001 Jun;69(6):899-906;BMC Bioinformatics. 2012 Sep 19;13:238;Microbiol Rev. 1995 Sep;59(3):451-80;Infect Dis Clin North Am. 2012 Mar;26(1):13-27;J Immunol. 2012 Jan 15;188(2):781-92;Scand J Infect Dis. 2003;35(2):98-103;J Clin Microbiol. 1987 Nov;25(11):2216-7;Mol Microbiol. 2008 May;68(4):997-1017;J Infect Dis. 1975 Feb;131(2):177-81;Infect Immun. 1998 Jan;66(1):330-5;J Bacteriol. 1995 Oct;177(19):5653-60;PLoS Pathog. 2016 Sep 08;12(9):e1005858;J Am Geriatr Soc. 2017 Feb;65(2):395-401;J Infect Dis. 2001 Aug 1;184(3):301-7;Invest Urol. 1979 Mar;16(5):327-8;Infect Immun. 2008 Jul;76(7):3054-63;Microbiol Immunol. 2001;45(1):9-15;Infect Immun. 2009 Feb;77(2):632-41;J Med Microbiol. 2009 Oct;58(Pt 10):1367-75;Clin Infect Dis. 2010 Mar 1;50(5):625-63;J Clin Microbiol. 1985 Nov;22(5):851-3	MEDLINE	epublish

Chromosome segregation in bacteria occurs concomitantly with DNA replication, and the duplicated regions containing the replication origin oriC are generally the first to separate and migrate to their final specific location inside the cell. In numerous bacterial species, a three-component partition machinery called the ParABS system is crucial for chromosome segregation. This is the case in the gammaproteobacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where impairing the ParABS system is very detrimental for growth, as it increases the generation time and leads to the formation of anucleate cells and to oriC mispositioning inside the cell. In this study, we investigate in vivo the ParABS system in P. aeruginosa. Using chromatin immuno-precipitation coupled with high throughput sequencing, we show that ParB binds to four parS site located within 15 kb of oriC in vivo, and that this binding promotes the formation of a high order nucleoprotein complex. We show that one parS site is enough to prevent anucleate cell formation, therefore for correct chromosome segregation. By displacing the parS site from its native position on the chromosome, we demonstrate that parS is the first chromosomal locus to be separated upon DNA replication, which indicates that it is the site of force exertion of the segregation process. We identify a region of approximatively 650 kb surrounding oriC in which the parS site must be positioned for chromosome segregation to proceed correctly, and we called it competence zone of the parS site. Mutant strains that have undergone specific genetic rearrangements allow us to propose that the distance between oriC and parS defines this competence zone. Implications for the control of chromosome segregation in P. aeruginosa are discussed.	12	11	e1006428	10.1371/journal.pgen.1006428	Lagage;Boccard;Vallet-Gely	Valentine;Frédéric;Isabelle	Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC), CEA, CNRS, Univ.

Microbiol.	1098-5336	Genomic and Transcriptional Mapping of PaMx41, Archetype of a New Lineage of Bacteriophages Infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	Previously, a collection of virulent phages infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from open water reservoirs and residual waters. Here, we described the comparative genomics of a set of five related phages from the collection, the physical structure of the genome, the structural proteomics of the virion, and the transcriptional program of archetypal phage PaMx41. The phage genomes were closely associated with each other and with those of two other P. aeruginosa phages, 119X and PaP2, which were previously filed in the databases. Overall, the genomes were approximately 43 kb, harboring 53 conserved open reading frames (ORFs) and three short ORFs in indel regions and containing 45% GC content. The genome of PaMx41 was further characterized as a linear, terminally redundant DNA molecule. A total of 16 ORFs were associated with putative functions, including nucleic acid metabolism, morphogenesis, and lysis, and eight virion proteins were identified through mass spectrometry. However, the coding sequences without assigned functions represent 70% of the ORFs. The PaMx41 transcription program was organized in early, middle, and late expressed genomic modules, which correlated with regions containing functionally related genes. The high genomic conservation among these distantly isolated phages suggests that these viruses undergo selective pressure to remain unchanged. The 119X lineage represents a unique set of phages that corresponds to a novel phage group. The features recognized in the genomes and the broad host range of clinical strains suggest that these phages are candidates for therapy applications.;Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes stubborn nosocomial infections that are frequently resistant to multiple antibiotics. Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages or phages) represent a natural mechanism for pathogenic bacterial control. Here, a group of virulent phages, previously shown to infect a broad range of clinical P. aeruginosa strains, was characterized at the genomic and molecular levels. These phages belong to a unique and tightly related group. In addition, we conducted a transcriptional study of an archetypal phage of this group to characterize the role of many unknown coding sequences based on expression temporalities. These results contribute to our knowledge of 119X-like phages and, in general, provide information concerning P. aeruginosa podophage diversity and lytic cycles.	82	22	6541-6547		Cruz-Plancarte;Cazares;Guarneros	Indira;Adrián;Gabriel	Departamento de Genética y Biología Molecular, Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CINVESTAV-IPN), Mexico City, Mexico.;Departamento de Genética y Biología Molecular, Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CINVESTAV-IPN), Mexico City, Mexico.;Departamento de Genética y Biología Molecular, Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CINVESTAV-IPN), Mexico City, Mexico gguarner@cinvestav.mx.	eng	Virology. 2008 Aug 1;377(2):233-8;ISME J. 2016 Jun;10(6):1437-55;Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Jan;38(Database issue):D366-70;Cell Microbiol. 2014 Dec;16(12):1822-35;J Virol. 1977 Sep;23(3):543-53;Adv Virus Res. 2012;82:179-288;Elife. 2015 Apr 28;4:e06416;BMC Evol Biol. 2015;15 Suppl 1:S1;PLoS One. 2014 Jan 20;9(1):e85806;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):821-9;F1000Prime Rep. 2014 Feb 03;6:9;Front Microbiol. 2014 Jul 24;5:355;Brief Bioinform. 2013 Mar;14(2):193-202;Bioinformatics. 2006 Dec 15;22(24):3099-100;Curr Protoc Bioinformatics. 2003 May;Chapter 4:Unit4.6;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jul 1;31(13):3688-91;PLoS One. 2011;6(5):e20095;Mol Gen Genet. 1978 Oct 30;166(2):127-40;J Virol. 2015 Aug;89(15):7449-56;Curr Opin Struct Biol. 2014 Jun;26:73-83;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;PLoS One. 2010 Jun 25;5(6):e11147;Cell Microbiol. 2007 Feb;9(2):479-91;Science. 2012 Sep 28;337(6102):1661-5;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2874-83;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1977 Dec;74(12):5305-9;Virology. 2010 Sep 15;405(1):26-30;PLoS One. 2015 Jan 28;10(1):e0117163;Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Jan;40(Database issue):D306-12;PLoS One. 2009 Nov 13;4(11):e7740;PLoS Comput Biol. 2009 May;5(5):e1000386;Genome Biol. 2004;5(2):R12;J Virol. 2014 Sep;88(18):10501-10;MBio. 2013 Mar 19;4(2):e00061-13;Bioinformatics. 2001 Dec;17(12):1123-30;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(3):1184-7;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2012 Jun;78(12):4510-5;J Bacteriol. 1992 Nov;174(21):6711-6;Anal Biochem. 1992 Feb 14;201(1):134-9;Genomics. 2012 Apr;99(4):233-40;Mol Biochem Parasitol. 2000 Feb 5;105(2):311-5;Comput Chem. 2001 Dec;26(1):51-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W244-8;Sci Rep. 2016 Jan 11;6:19237;Virol J. 2011 Mar 23;8:134;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2008 Jan;32(1):38-55;BMC Bioinformatics. 2008 Jan 29;9:65	MEDLINE	epublish

Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis.	1435-4373	Uncommonly isolated clinical Pseudomonas: identification and phylogenetic assignation.	Fifty-two Pseudomonas strains that were difficult to identify at the species level in the phenotypic routine characterizations employed by clinical microbiology laboratories were selected for genotypic-based analysis. Species level identifications were done initially by partial sequencing of the DNA dependent RNA polymerase sub-unit D gene (rpoD). Two other gene sequences, for the small sub-unit ribosonal RNA (16S rRNA) and for DNA gyrase sub-unit B (gyrB) were added in a multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) study to confirm the species identifications. These sequences were analyzed with a collection of reference sequences from the type strains of 161 Pseudomonas species within an in-house multi-locus sequence analysis database. Whole-cell matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analyses of these strains complemented the DNA sequenced-based phylogenetic analyses and were observed to be in accordance with the results of the sequence data. Twenty-three out of 52 strains were assigned to 12 recognized species not commonly detected in clinical specimens and 29 (56 %) were considered representatives of at least ten putative new species. Most strains were distributed within the P. fluorescens and P. aeruginosa lineages. The value of rpoD sequences in species-level identifications for Pseudomonas is emphasized. The correct species identifications of clinical strains is essential for establishing the intrinsic antibiotic resistance patterns and improved treatment plans.	36	2	351-359	10.1007/s10096-016-2808-4	Mulet;Gomila;Ramírez;Cardew;Moore;Lalucat;García-Valdés	M;M;A;S;E R B;J;E	Department of Biology, Microbiology, Edificio Guillem Colom, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Crtra.Valldemossa km 7.5, 07122, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Department of Biology, Microbiology, Edificio Guillem Colom, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Crtra.Valldemossa km 7.5, 07122, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Servicio de Microbiología, Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Department of Infectious Disease, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy of the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.;Department of Infectious Disease, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy of the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.;Department of Biology, Microbiology, Edificio Guillem Colom, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Crtra.Valldemossa km 7.5, 07122, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Institut Mediterrani d'Estudis Avançats (IMEDEA, CSIC-UIB), Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Department of Biology, Microbiology, Edificio Guillem Colom, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Crtra.Valldemossa km 7.5, 07122, Palma de Mallorca, Spain. elena.garciavaldes@uib.es.;Institut Mediterrani d'Estudis Avançats (IMEDEA, CSIC-UIB), Palma de Mallorca, Spain. elena.garciavaldes@uib.es.	eng	Appl Environ Microbiol. 2015 Oct 30;82(1):375-83;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2016 Mar;66(3):1163-73;Mol Cell Probes. 2009 Jun-Aug;23(3-4):140-7;Syst Appl Microbiol. 2014 Mar;37(2):89-94;Mol Biol Evol. 2011 Oct;28(10):2731-9;Yale J Biol Med. 1971 Dec;44(3):265-73;Front Microbiol. 2015 Mar 18;6:214;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2006 Nov;56(Pt 11):2657-63;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jun;12(6):1513-30;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2007 May;57(Pt 5):979-85;Syst Appl Microbiol. 2014 Sep;37(6):412-6;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2013 Dec;63(Pt 12):4413-20;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2005 Feb;25(2):95-109;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2002 Mar;52(Pt 2):363-76;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2014 Jan;64(Pt 1):95-100;Syst Appl Microbiol. 2012 Oct;35(7):455-64;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2004 Sep;54(Pt 5):1633-7;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2008 Oct;58(Pt 10):2309-15;Microb Ecol. 2013 Oct;66(3):522-32;PLoS One. 2016 Feb 26;11(2):e0148796;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2014 Aug;80(15):4738-44;Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2012 Sep;31(9):2133-9	MEDLINE	ppublish

Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections cause significant morbidity in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Over years to decades, P. aeruginosa adapts genetically as it establishes chronic lung infections. Nonsynonymous mutations in lasR, the quorum-sensing (QS) master regulator, are common in CF. In laboratory strains of P. aeruginosa, LasR activates transcription of dozens of genes, including that for another QS regulator, RhlR. Despite the frequency with which lasR coding variants have been reported to occur in P. aeruginosa CF isolates, little is known about their consequences for QS. We sequenced lasR from 2,583 P. aeruginosa CF isolates. The lasR sequences of 580 isolates (22%) coded for polypeptides that differed from the conserved LasR polypeptides of well-studied laboratory strains. This collection included 173 unique lasR coding variants, 116 of which were either missense or nonsense mutations. We studied 31 of these variants. About one-sixth of the variant LasR proteins were functional, including 3 with nonsense mutations, and in some LasR-null isolates, genes that are LasR dependent in laboratory strains were nonetheless expressed. Furthermore, about half of the LasR-null isolates retained RhlR activity. Therefore, in some CF isolates the QS hierarchy is altered such that RhlR quorum sensing is independent of LasR regulation. Our analysis challenges the view that QS-silent P. aeruginosa is selected during the course of a chronic CF lung infection. Rather, some lasR sequence variants retain functionality, and many employ an alternate QS strategy involving RhlR.;Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, such as those in patients with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, are notable in that mutants with defects in the quorum-sensing transcription factor LasR frequently arise. In laboratory strains of P. aeruginosa, quorum sensing activates transcription of dozens of genes, many of which encode virulence factors, such as secreted proteases and hydrogen cyanide synthases. In well-studied laboratory strains, LasR-null mutants have a quorum-sensing-deficient phenotype. Therefore, the presence of LasR variants in chronic infections has been interpreted to indicate that quorum-sensing-regulated products are not important for those infections. We report that some P. aeruginosa LasR variant clinical isolates are not LasR-null mutants, and others have uncoupled a second quorum-sensing system, the RhlR system, from LasR regulation. In these uncoupled isolates, RhlR independently activates at least some quorum-sensing-dependent genes. Our findings suggest that quorum sensing plays a role in chronic P. aeruginosa infections, despite the emergence of LasR coding variants.	7	5		10.1128/mBio.01513-16	Feltner;Wolter;Pope;Groleau;Smalley;Greenberg;Mayer-Hamblett;Burns;Déziel;Hoffman;Dandekar	John B;Daniel J;Christopher E;Marie-Christine;Nicole E;E Peter;Nicole;Jane;Eric;Lucas R;Ajai A	Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.;Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington, USA.;Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.;INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Laval, Québec, Canada.;Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.;Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.;Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington, USA.;Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington, USA.;INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Laval, Québec, Canada.;Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington, USA.;Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA dandekar@u.washington.edu.	eng	ISME J. 2015 Aug;9(8):1734-46;PLoS One. 2014 Feb 12;9(2):e88743;Infect Immun. 1998 Sep;66(9):4499-502;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Mar 28;97(7):3526-31;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Apr 14;106(15):6339-44;Science. 1999 May 21;284(5418):1318-22;J Bacteriol. 2001 Jan;183(1):382-6;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;Infect Immun. 2009 Dec;77(12):5631-9;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jul;187(13):4372-80;Methods Mol Biol. 2011;692:61-9;Pediatr Pulmonol. 2010 Sep;45(9):934-44;J Microbiol Methods. 2006 Mar;64(3):391-7;Science. 1993 May 21;260(5111):1127-30;PLoS Pathog. 2010 Jan 08;6(1):e1000712;J Hosp Infect. 1999 Nov;43(3):211-8;Sci Adv. 2015 Jul;1(6):null;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2000 Nov;13(11):1243-50;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Dec;62(6):1689-99;J Bacteriol. 1994 Jan;176(2):269-75;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Oct;50(1):29-43;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 3;101(5):1339-44;Science. 2012 Oct 12;338(6104):264-6;J Bacteriol. 2003 Apr;185(7):2080-95;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Sep 28;96(20):11229-34;J Bacteriol. 1997 May;179(10):3127-32;MBio. 2011 Oct 11;2(5):null;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Jan;59(2):602-9;J Bacteriol. 1997 Sep;179(18):5756-67;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006 Nov;50(11):3674-9;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jun;12(6):1659-73;Microbiology. 2009 Mar;155(Pt 3):712-23;Infect Immun. 1999 Nov;67(11):5854-62;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Feb;55(4):998-1014;J Bacteriol. 2008 Nov;190(21):7043-51;Chem Biol. 2015 May 21;22(5):611-8;PLoS One. 2010 Apr 12;5(4):e10115;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2014 Aug 1;190(3):289-97;J Infect Dis. 2001 Feb 1;183(3):444-52;J Biol Chem. 2007 May 4;282(18):13592-600;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Oct 2;104(40):15876-81;Int J Med Microbiol. 2006 Apr;296(2-3):73-81;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Feb 28;92(5):1490-4;J Cyst Fibros. 2009 Jan;8(1):66-70;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Jun 10;94(12):6036-41;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2006 Aug;4(8):597-607;J Lab Clin Med. 1954 Aug;44(2):301-7;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Apr;64(2):512-33;J Bacteriol. 1995 Dec;177(24):7155-63;J Bacteriol. 2003 Apr;185(7):2066-79;PLoS Pathog. 2010 Mar 12;6(3):e1000810;Nature. 2002 Jun 27;417(6892):971-4;J Med Microbiol. 1996 Aug;45(2):110-9;J Bacteriol. 2001 Jan;183(1):387-92;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Feb 27;98(5):2752-7;Infect Immun. 2014 Aug;82(8):3312-23;Infect Immun. 1996 Jan;64(1):37-43;Biochim Biophys Acta. 2003 Jun 20;1622(1):36-41;Clin Infect Dis. 2014 Sep 1;59(5):624-31	MEDLINE	epublish

Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. abscessus (MAB) is a highly drug resistant mycobacterium and the most common respiratory pathogen among the rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria. MAB is also one of the most deadly of the emerging cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogens requiring prolonged treatment with multiple antibiotics. In addition to its mycobacterial virulence genes, the genome of MAB harbours a large accessory genome, presumably acquired via lateral gene transfer including homologs shared with the CF pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia. While multiple genome sequences are available there is little functional genomics data available for this important pathogen.;We report here the first multi-omics approach to characterize the primary transcriptome, coding potential and potential regulatory regions of the MAB genome utilizing differential RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq), RNA-seq, Ribosome profiling and LC-MS proteomics. In addition we attempt to address the genomes contribution to the molecular systems that underlie MAB's adaptation and persistence in the human host through an examination of MABs transcriptional response to a number of clinically relevant conditions. These include hypoxia, exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics and growth in an artificial sputum designed to mimic the conditions within the cystic fibrosis lung.;Our integrated map provides the first comprehensive view of the primary transcriptome of MAB and evidence for the translation of over one hundred new short open reading frames (sORFs). Our map will act as a resource for ongoing functional genomics characterization of MAB and our transcriptome data from clinically relevant stresses informs our understanding of MAB's adaptation to life in the CF lung. MAB's adaptation to growth in artificial CF sputum highlights shared metabolic strategies with other CF pathogens including P. aeruginosa and mirrors the transcriptional responses that lead to persistence in mycobacteria. These strategies include an increased reliance on amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid catabolism and highlights the relevance of the glyoxylate shunt to growth in the CF lung. Our data suggests that, similar to what is seen in chronically persisting P. aeruginosa, progression towards a biofilm mode of growth would play a more prominent role in a longer-term MAB infection. Finally, MAB's transcriptional response to antibiotics highlights the role of antibiotic modifications enzymes, active transport and the evolutionarily conserved WhiB7 driven antibiotic resistance regulon.	17		553	10.1186/s12864-016-2868-y	Miranda-CasoLuengo;Staunton;Dinan;Lohan;Loftus	Aleksandra A;Patrick M;Adam M;Amanda J;Brendan J	School of Medicine, Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, RmG043 Conway Institute, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.;School of Medicine, Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, RmG043 Conway Institute, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.;School of Medicine, Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, RmG043 Conway Institute, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.;APC Microbiome Institute, Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.;School of Medicine, Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, RmG043 Conway Institute, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland. brendan.loftus@ucd.ie.	eng	J Antimicrob Chemother. 2015 May;70(5):1412-9;Int J Med Microbiol. 2010 Dec;300(8):557-62;J Bacteriol. 2007 Apr;189(7):2583-9;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Apr;53(4):1367-76;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 May;56(5):2643-51;PLoS One. 2009 Jun 19;4(6):e5660;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Jan 19;113(3):E348-57;Sci Rep. 2016 Jan 25;6:19695;Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom. 2012 Mar 30;26(6):679-85;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Feb;43(3):717-31;MBio. 2014 Jun 03;5(3):e01106-14;PLoS Pathog. 2011 Nov;7(11):e1002342;J Bacteriol. 2013 Oct;195(20):4592-9;Mol Microbiol. 2013 Nov;90(3):612-29;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Jun;64(6):1442-54;Nat Protoc. 2012 Jul 26;7(8):1534-50;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2015 Oct;59(10):6161-9;J Biol Chem. 2013 Mar 8;288(10):6788-800;Cell Rep. 2014 Sep 11;8(5):1365-79;Front Microbiol. 2011 May 13;2:105;J Med Microbiol. 2010 Sep;59(Pt 9):1089-100;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Aug;53(8):3181-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Dec;41(22):10062-76;J Bacteriol. 2013 Apr;195(8):1769-78;Annu Rev Genet. 2013;47:625-46;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Mar 31;112(13):4110-5;J Exp Med. 2003 Sep 1;198(5):705-13;Nature. 2012 Mar 28;484(7395):538-41;Infect Immun. 2009 Nov;77(11):5071-9;Cell. 2010 Sep 3;142(5):737-48;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2012 Apr;67(4):810-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014;58(1):212-20;PLoS Genet. 2015 Nov 04;11(11):e1005641;Infect Immun. 2007 Nov;75(11):5313-24;Microbiology. 2011 Aug;157(Pt 8):2357-68;J Infect Dis. 2009 Jul 1;200(1):118-30;MBio. 2014 Aug 05;5(4):e01169-14;Sci Signal. 2012 Jan 24;5(208):ra7;Mol Microbiol. 2012 May;84(4):664-81;J Bacteriol. 2011 Jul;193(14):3446-52;Annu Rev Biochem. 2014;83:753-77	MEDLINE	epublish

Bioprospecting natural products in marine bacteria from fjord environments are attractive due to their unique geographical features. Although, Actinobacteria are well known for producing a myriad of bioactive compounds, investigations regarding fjord-derived marine Actinobacteria are scarce. In this study, the diversity and biotechnological potential of Actinobacteria isolated from marine sediments within the Comau fjord, in Northern Chilean Patagonia, were assessed by culture-based approaches. The 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that members phylogenetically related to the Micrococcaceae, Dermabacteraceae, Brevibacteriaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, Microbacteriaceae, Dietziaceae, Nocardiaceae, and Streptomycetaceae families were present at the Comau fjord. A high diversity of cultivable Actinobacteria (10 genera) was retrieved by using only five different isolation media. Four isolates belonging to Arthrobacter, Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium and Kocuria genera showed 16S rRNA gene identity <98.7% suggesting that they are novel species. Physiological features such as salt tolerance, artificial sea water requirement, growth temperature, pigmentation and antimicrobial activity were evaluated. Arthrobacter, Brachybacterium, Curtobacterium, Rhodococcus, and Streptomyces isolates showed strong inhibition against both Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial activities in Brachybacterium, Curtobacterium, and Rhodococcus have been scarcely reported, suggesting that non-mycelial strains are a suitable source of bioactive compounds.

Immun.	1098-5522	Use of a Multiplex Transcript Method for Analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Gene Expression Profiles in the Cystic Fibrosis Lung.	The discovery of therapies that modulate Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence or that can eradicate chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) will be advanced by an improved understanding of P. aeruginosa behavior in vivo We demonstrate the use of multiplexed Nanostring technology to monitor relative abundances of P. aeruginosa transcripts across clinical isolates, in serial samples, and for the purposes of comparing microbial physiology in vitro and in vivo The expression of 75 transcripts encoded by genes implicated in CF lung disease was measured in a variety of P. aeruginosa strains as well as RNA serial sputum samples from four P. aeruginosa-colonized subjects with CF collected over 6 months. We present data on reproducibility, the results from different methods of normalization, and demonstrate high concordance between transcript relative abundance data obtained by Nanostring or transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis. Furthermore, we address considerations regarding sequence variation between strains during probe design. Analysis of P. aeruginosa grown in vitro identified transcripts that correlated with the different phenotypes commonly observed in CF clinical isolates. P. aeruginosa transcript profiles in RNA from CF sputum indicated alginate production in vivo, and transcripts involved in quorum-sensing regulation were less abundant in sputum than strains grown in the laboratory. P. aeruginosa gene expression patterns from sputum clustered closely together relative to patterns for laboratory-grown cultures; in contrast, laboratory-grown P. aeruginosa showed much greater transcriptional variation with only loose clustering of strains with different phenotypes. The clustering within and between subjects was surprising in light of differences in inhaled antibiotic and respiratory symptoms, suggesting that the pathways represented by these 75 transcripts are stable in chronic CF P. aeruginosa lung infections.	84	10	2995-3006	10.1128/IAI.00437-16	Gifford;Willger;Dolben;Moulton;Dorman;Bean;Hill;Hampton;Ashare;Hogan	Alex H;Sven D;Emily L;Lisa A;Dana B;Heather;Jane E;Thomas H;Alix;Deborah A	Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA giffora@hitchcock.org dhogan@dartmouth.edu.;Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.;Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.;Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.;Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.;School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA.;Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.;Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.;Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.;Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA giffora@hitchcock.org dhogan@dartmouth.edu.	eng	Clin J Pain. 2006 Jul-Aug;22(6):532-7;Pediatr Pulmonol. 2011 Feb;46(2):160-5;Eur Respir J. 2007 Aug;30(2):286-92;Nat Biotechnol. 2008 Mar;26(3):317-25;PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e37908;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;J Psychosom Res. 2011 Feb;70(2):161-7;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Aug 2;102(31):11082-7;MBio. 2013 Aug 20;4(4):null;J Bacteriol. 2007 Dec;189(23):8667-76;JAMA. 2005 Feb 2;293(5):581-8;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2015 Feb 1;191(3):309-15;Curr Protoc Mol Biol. 2011 Apr;Chapter 25:Unit25B.10;J Bacteriol. 1994 Feb;176(4):1128-40;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;Sci Rep. 2015 Jun 05;5:10932;PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60225;Lancet. 1986 Feb 8;1(8476):307-10;PLoS Pathog. 2010 Jan 08;6(1):e1000712;Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2012 Dec;47(6):738-45;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2012 Dec;10(12):841-51;J Biol Chem. 2015 Mar 20;290(12):7756-66;Eur Respir J. 2014 Oct;44(4):922-30;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2005 Jun;55(6):921-7;N Engl J Med. 2015 Oct 29;373(18):1783-4;Ann Oncol. 2014 Feb;25(2):339-45;Infect Immun. 2004 Jan;72(1):133-44;J Bacteriol. 2010 Dec;192(23):6191-9;J Clin Microbiol. 2003 Aug;41(8):3526-31;MBio. 2015 Jun 30;6(4):e00749;J Bacteriol. 2004 Apr;186(7):2115-22;Infect Immun. 2011 Dec;79(12):4802-18;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2004 Jul;48(7):2659-64;J Bacteriol. 2012 Sep;194(18):4857-66;Infect Immun. 2009 Mar;77(3):1103-11;Eur Respir J. 2013 Aug;42(2):371-9;J Bacteriol. 1997 May;179(10):3127-32;Chest. 2013 Sep;144(3):981-9;Chest. 2003 May;123(5):1495-502;Microbiology. 2011 Jun;157(Pt 6):1726-39;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2011 Aug 1;184(3):345-54;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1999 Mar;65(3):1175-9;Thorax. 2011 Jul;66(7):579-84;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2009 Jul 15;180(2):138-45;J Bacteriol. 2003 Feb;185(4):1316-25;Microbiology. 2013 Nov;159(Pt 11):2354-63;J Bacteriol. 2005 Mar;187(6):2138-47;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2014 Aug 1;190(3):289-97;Chest. 2009 Jun;135(6):1610-8;Pediatr Pulmonol. 2011 Jan;46(1):36-44;Infect Immun. 2013 Aug;81(8):2697-704;Microbiol Rev. 1996 Sep;60(3):539-74;Infect Immun. 1990 Oct;58(10):3363-8;N Engl J Med. 2011 Nov 3;365(18):1663-72;Infect Immun. 2008 Apr;76(4):1423-33;BMC Microbiol. 2013 Oct 18;13:232;Nature. 2002 Apr 18;416(6882):740-3;J Bacteriol. 2006 Sep;188(18):6483-9;J Cyst Fibros. 2014 May;13(3):289-95;Chest. 2005 Oct;128(4):2347-54;J Cyst Fibros. 2009 Jan;8(1):66-70;EMBO J. 2003 Jun 16;22(12 ):2959-69;PLoS One. 2013 Dec 06;8(12):e82621;Sci Rep. 2015 Jan 12;5:7649;Pediatr Pulmonol. 2009 Jun;44(6):547-58;Nature. 2000 Oct 12;407(6805):762-4;Microbiology. 1996 Aug;142 ( Pt 8):2145-51;Trends Microbiol. 2005 Feb;13(2):58-63;PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e45001;J Bacteriol. 2015 Sep;197(17):2810-20;Infect Immun. 2007 Nov;75(11):5313-24;Biometals. 2011 Dec;24(6):1059-67;J Infect Dis. 2009 Jul 1;200(1):118-30;J Clin Psychol Med Settings. 2010 Mar;17(1):49-55;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2009 Apr;12(2):182-91;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Oct 29;110(44):17981-6;J Clin Invest. 2006 Feb;116(2):436-46;J Bacteriol. 2012 Oct;194(19):5315-24;J Bacteriol. 1996 Apr;178(8):2186-95;J Cyst Fibros. 2012 Jul;11(4):288-92;Microbiome. 2013 Nov 01;1(1):27;Clin Infect Dis. 2014 Sep 1;59(5):624-31;Chest. 2009 May;135(5):1223-32;Infect Immun. 2007 Aug;75(8):3902-12	MEDLINE	epublish

Bacteriol.	1098-5530	Choline Catabolism in Burkholderia thailandensis Is Regulated by Multiple Glutamine Amidotransferase 1-Containing AraC Family Transcriptional Regulators.	Burkholderia thailandensis is a soil-dwelling bacterium that shares many metabolic pathways with the ecologically similar, but evolutionarily distant, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Among the diverse nutrients it can utilize is choline, metabolizable to the osmoprotectant glycine betaine and subsequently catabolized as a source of carbon and nitrogen, similar to P. aeruginosa Orthologs of genes in the choline catabolic pathway in these two bacteria showed distinct differences in gene arrangement as well as an additional orthologous transcriptional regulator in B. thailandensis In this study, we showed that multiple glutamine amidotransferase 1 (GATase 1)-containing AraC family transcription regulators (GATRs) are involved in regulation of the B. thailandensis choline catabolic pathway (gbdR1, gbdR2, and souR). Using genetic analyses and sequencing the transcriptome in the presence and absence of choline, we identified the likely regulons of gbdR1 (BTH_II1869) and gbdR2 (BTH_II0968). We also identified a functional ortholog for P. aeruginosa souR, a GATR that regulates the metabolism of sarcosine to glycine. GbdR1 is absolutely required for expression of the choline catabolic locus, similar to P. aeruginosa GbdR, while GbdR2 is important to increase expression of the catabolic locus. Additionally, the B. thailandensis SouR ortholog (BTH_II0994) is required for catabolism of choline and its metabolites as carbon sources, whereas in P. aeruginosa, SouR function can by bypassed by GbdR. The strategy employed by B. thailandensis represents a distinct regulatory solution to control choline catabolism and thus provides both an evolutionary counterpoint and an experimental system to analyze the acquisition and regulation of this pathway during environmental growth and infection.;Many proteobacteria that occupy similar environmental niches have horizontally acquired orthologous genes for metabolism of compounds useful in their shared environment. The arrangement and differential regulation of these components can help us understand both the evolution of these systems and the potential roles these pathways have in the biology of each bacterium. Here, we describe the transcriptome response of Burkholderia thailandensis to the eukaryote-enriched molecule choline, identify the regulatory pathway governing choline catabolism, and compare the pathway to that previously described for Pseudomonas aeruginosa These data support a multitiered regulatory network in B. thailandensis, with conserved orthologs in the select agents Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei, as well as the opportunistic lung pathogens in the Burkholderia cepacia clade.	198	18	2503-14	10.1128/JB.00372-16	Nock;Wargo	Adam M;Matthew J	Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont, USA The Vermont Lung Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont, USA mwargo@uvm.edu.	eng	J Bacteriol. 2011 Jun;193(12):3033-41;PLoS One. 2014 Jan 08;9(1):e83779;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 May;74(10):2985-9;J Bacteriol. 1987 Jul;169(7):3023-8;J Biol Chem. 1984 Aug 10;259(15):9790-8;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jun;186(12):3848-54;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2009 Jun;75(12):4015-27;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1991 Aug 1;66(2):131-5;Mol Microbiol. 2010 Jan;75(1):29-45;Microbiology. 2006 May;152(Pt 5):1395-406;J Bacteriol. 1973 Jan;113(1):218-23;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 Feb;74(4):1064-75;Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2001 Dec;25(6):725-31;J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(8):2690-9;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2011 Jul;77(13):4383-9;Arch Mikrobiol. 1970;71(3):235-44;J Bacteriol. 1988 Jul;170(7):3142-9;Arch Microbiol. 2006 Mar;185(1):14-22;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2010 Sep;34(5):779-96;Mol Biol Evol. 2013 Dec;30(12):2725-9;BMC Microbiol. 2010 Jan 29;10:28;PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56850;Int J Syst Bacteriol. 1998 Jan;48 Pt 1:317-20;Am J Clin Nutr. 2004 Sep;80(3):539-49;Plasmid. 2009 Sep;62(2):88-97;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Mar 19;32(5):1792-7;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2011 Aug 1;184(3):345-54;Biochem J. 1993 Aug 15;294 ( Pt 1):1-14;Curr Protoc Microbiol. 2012 May;Chapter 6:Unit 6E.1.;J Infect Dis. 1985 Dec;152(6):1308-16;J Infect Dis. 1992 Dec;166(6):1311-5;BMC Genomics. 2005 Dec 07;6:174;Infect Immun. 2001 Jan;69(1):34-44;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2013 Apr;79(7):2112-20;J Bacteriol. 2014 Jan;196(1):7-15;PLoS One. 2014 Jul 28;9(7):e103778;Extremophiles. 2013 Jul;17(4):601-10;Mol Microbiol. 2008 May;68(3):657-71;Infect Immun. 2000 Mar;68(3):1681-6;J Bacteriol. 2015 Oct 26;198(2):301-10;Mol Microbiol. 1992 Apr;6(7):863-71;Eur J Biochem. 2001 Jun;268(12):3390-8;Nat Protoc. 2006;1(1):162-9;BMC Microbiol. 2006 May 26;6:46;Infect Immun. 2008 Nov;76(11):5402-11;J Bacteriol. 1996 Mar;178(6):1663-70;J Biol Chem. 1999 Jul 9;274(28):20011-6;Bioinformatics. 2009 Jul 15;25(14):1754-60;J Bacteriol. 2012 Sep;194(17):4718-26;PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e49745;J Bacteriol. 2007 Oct;189(19):6901-12;J Gen Microbiol. 1988 Jun;134(6):1737-46;PLoS Comput Biol. 2013;9(8):e1003118;Nat Protoc. 2006;1(1):153-61	MEDLINE	epublish

As interest in the therapeutic and biotechnological potentials of bacteriophages has grown, so has value in understanding their basic biology. However, detailed knowledge of infection cycles has been limited to a small number of model bacteriophages, mostly infecting Escherichia coli. We present here the first analysis coupling data obtained from global next-generation approaches, RNA-Sequencing and metabolomics, to characterize interactions between the virulent bacteriophage PAK_P3 and its host Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We detected a dramatic global depletion of bacterial transcripts coupled with their replacement by viral RNAs over the course of infection, eventually leading to drastic changes in pyrimidine metabolism. This process relies on host machinery hijacking as suggested by the strong up-regulation of one bacterial operon involved in RNA processing. Moreover, we found that RNA-based regulation plays a central role in PAK_P3 lifecycle as antisense transcripts are produced mainly during the early stage of infection and viral small non coding RNAs are massively expressed at the end of infection. This work highlights the prominent role of RNA metabolism in the infection strategy of a bacteriophage belonging to a new characterized sub-family of viruses with promising therapeutic potential.	12	7	e1006134	10.1371/journal.pgen.1006134	Chevallereau;Blasdel;De Smet;Monot;Zimmermann;Kogadeeva;Sauer;Jorth;Whiteley;Debarbieux;Lavigne	Anne;Bob G;Jeroen;Marc;Michael;Maria;Uwe;Peter;Marvin;Laurent;Rob	Institut Pasteur, Molecular Biology of the Gene in Extremophiles Unit, Department of Microbiology, Paris, France.;Université Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Cellule Pasteur, Paris, France.;Laboratory of Gene Technology, Department of Biosystems, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Laboratory of Gene Technology, Department of Biosystems, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Institut Pasteur, Laboratoire Pathogenèse des bactéries anaérobies, Département de Microbiologie, Paris, France.;Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland.;Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland.;Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland.;Department of Molecular Biosciences, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Center for Infectious Disease, University of Texas, Austin, Texas, United States of America.;Department of Molecular Biosciences, Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Center for Infectious Disease, University of Texas, Austin, Texas, United States of America.;Institut Pasteur, Molecular Biology of the Gene in Extremophiles Unit, Department of Microbiology, Paris, France.;Laboratory of Gene Technology, Department of Biosystems, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.	eng	Cell. 1993 Oct 8;75(1):147-54;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Oct 25;102(43):15545-50;Methods Mol Biol. 2009;501:175-202;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2014 Jun;19:59-69;Virology. 1966 Jan;28(1):163-5;Bacteriophage. 2012 Jan 1;2(1):50-54;Cell Microbiol. 2014 Dec;16(12):1822-35;Sci Rep. 2015 May 11;5:10080;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104;Nature. 2014 Jun 5;510(7503):15-6;PLoS Pathog. 2012 Sep;8(9):e1002945;OMICS. 2014 Mar;18(3):184-95;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Dec;57(12):5961-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Oct 21;111(42):15096-101;J Biol Chem. 2011 Mar 11;286(10):7727-31;ISME J. 2016 Aug;10(8):1823-35;Acta Biochim Pol. 1998;45(4):895-906;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2007 Oct;10(5):461-72;Mol Cell. 2014 Jul 17;55(2):199-213;Stand Genomic Sci. 2011 Apr 29;4(2):244-51;Virology. 2004 Nov 10;329(1):134-41;Plasmid. 2015 Mar;78:71-8;PLoS One. 2015 Jan 28;10(1):e0117163;Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci. 2009;85:43-89;Environ Microbiol Rep. 2015 Apr;7(2):227-36;Mol Microbiol. 2013 May;88(3):577-89;Viruses. 2015 Dec 12;7(12):6570-89;J Virol. 2014 Sep;88(18):10501-10;J Biol Chem. 2011 Feb 11;286(6):4117-22;MBio. 2013 Mar 19;4(2):e00061-13;Cell. 1985 Jun;41(2):339-40;ISME J. 2014 May;8(5):1089-100;Biomolecules. 2015 Apr 27;5(2):647-67;J Virol. 2012 Jun;86(11):6369-70;Anal Chem. 2013 Sep 3;85(17):8284-90;Curr Protein Pept Sci. 2012 Dec;13(8):699-722;EMBO J. 1990 May;9(5):1383-9;PLoS One. 2011 Feb 15;6(2):e16963;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1972 Dec;69(12):3703-7;Anal Chem. 2011 Sep 15;83(18):7074-80;Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):2006-16;RNA Biol. 2012 Apr;9(4):364-71;PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36553;Genome Biol. 2014;15(12):550	MEDLINE	epublish

Bull.	1879-3363	Antibiotic and metal resistance in a ST395 Pseudomonas aeruginosa environmental isolate: A genomics approach.	We analyzed the resistome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa E67, an epiphytic isolate from a metal-contaminated estuary. The aim was to identify genetic determinants of resistance to antibiotics and metals, assessing possible co-selection mechanisms. Identification was based on phylogenetic analysis and average nucleotide identity value calculation. MLST affiliated E67 to ST395, previously described as a high-risk clone. Genome analysis allowed identifying genes probably involved in resistance to antibiotics (e.g. beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol) and metals (e.g. mercury and copper), consistent with resistance phenotypes. Several genes associated with efflux systems, as well as genetic determinants contributing to gene motility, were identified. Pseudomonas aeruginosa E67 possesses an arsenal of resistance determinants, probably contributing to adaptation to a polluted ecosystem. Association to mobile structures highlights the role of these platforms in multi-drug resistance. Physical links between metal and antibiotic resistance genes were not identified, suggesting a predominance of cross-resistance associated with multidrug efflux pumps.	110	1	75-81	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.06.086	Teixeira;Tacão;Alves;Henriques	Pedro;Marta;Artur;Isabel	Biology Department, CESAM & IBIMED, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.;Biology Department, CESAM & IBIMED, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.

Glycine serves as a major source of single carbon units for biochemical reactions within bacterial cells. Utilization of glycine is tightly regulated and revolves around a key group of proteins known as the glycine cleavage system (GCS). Our lab previously identified the transcriptional regulator GcsR (PA2449) as being required for catabolism of glycine in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. In an effort to clarify and have an overall better understanding of the role of GcsR in glycine metabolism, a combination of transcriptome sequencing and electrophoretic mobility shift assays was used to identify target genes of this transcriptional regulator. It was found that GcsR binds to an 18-bp consensus sequence (TGTAACG-N4-CGTTCCG) upstream of the gcs2 operon, consisting of the gcvH2, gcvP2, glyA2, sdaA, and gcvT2 genes. The proteins encoded by these genes, namely, the GCS (GcvH2-GcvP2-GcvT2), serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GlyA2), and serine dehydratase (SdaA), form a metabolic pathway for the conversion of glycine into pyruvate, which can enter the central metabolism. GcsR activates transcription of the gcs2 operon in response to glycine. Interestingly, GcsR belongs to a family of transcriptional regulators known as TyrR-like enhancer-binding proteins (EBPs). Until this study, TyrR-like EBPs were only known to function in regulating aromatic amino acid metabolism. GcsR is the founding member of a new class of TyrR-like EBPs that function in the regulation of glycine metabolism. Indeed, homologs of GcsR and its target genes are present in almost all sequenced genomes of the Pseudomonadales order, suggesting that this genetic regulatory mechanism is a common theme for pseudomonads. IMPORTANCE Glycine is required for various cellular functions, including cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, and the biosynthesis of several important metabolites. Regulating levels of glycine metabolism allows P. aeruginosa to maintain the metabolic flux of glycine through several pathways, including the metabolism of glycine to produce other amino acids, entry into the trichloroacetic acid cycle, and the production of virulence factors such as hydrogen cyanide. In this study, we characterized GcsR, a transcriptional regulator that activates the expression of genes involved in P. aeruginosa PAO1 glycine metabolism. Our work reveals that GcsR is the founding member of a novel class of TyrR-like EBPs that likely regulate glycine metabolism in Pseudomonadales.	1	2		10.1128/mSphere.00020-16	Sarwar;Lundgren;Grassa;Wang;Gribble;Moffat;Nomura	Zaara;Benjamin R;Michael T;Michael X;Megan;Jennifer F;Christopher T	Department of Chemistry, State University of New York-College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, New York, USA.;Department of Chemistry, State University of New York-College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, New York, USA.;Department of Chemistry, State University of New York-College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, New York, USA.;Department of Chemistry, State University of New York-College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, New York, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, USA.;Department of Chemistry, State University of New York-College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, New York, USA; Center for Applied Microbiology, State University of New York-College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, New York, USA; Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Green Transformation of Bio-Resources, College of Life Sciences, Hubei University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.	eng	Microbiology. 2002 Jul;148(Pt 7):2203-14;PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24310;Arch Microbiol. 2000 Mar;173(3):170-7;Environ Microbiol. 2007 Nov;9(11):2683-93;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol. 2001 Oct;3(4):529-43;Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci. 2008;84(7):246-63;MBio. 2013 Jan 29;4(1):e00526-12;J Bacteriol. 2001 Sep;183(18):5213-22;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Apr 13;96(8):4360-5;Microbiology. 2007 May;153(Pt 5):1604-8;World J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2014 Apr;30(4):1159-68;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2012 Sep;76(3):497-529;Mol Cell Biochem. 1973 Jun 27;1(2):169-87;J Bacteriol. 2012 Sep;194(17 ):4698-708;J Bacteriol. 2010 Feb;192(4):1113-21;J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(8):2690-9;J Bacteriol. 1969 Jan;97(1):282-91;J Bacteriol. 1989 Aug;171(8):4326-33;Biochim Biophys Acta. 1976 Jan 14;421(1):97-105;J Cyst Fibros. 2010 May;9(3):158-64;J Bacteriol. 1985 Jul;163(1):1-7;Mol Syst Biol. 2006;2:2006.0008;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Nov 25;100(24):14339-44;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jun;12(6):1427-38;Mol Microbiol. 1996 Nov;22(3):497-507;J Bacteriol. 2000 May;182(10):2702-8;J Bacteriol. 2001 Nov;183(21):6207-14;Am J Pathol. 2009 Dec;175(6):2473-88;Biochem J. 1955 Oct;61(2):315-23;J Bacteriol. 2014 Jan;196(1):7-15;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Jan;55(1):16-26;J Mol Biol. 2007 Mar 16;367(1):102-12;Trends Mol Med. 2004 Dec;10(12):599-606;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Feb 28;92(5):1490-4;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jan;42(2):979-98;J Bacteriol. 2013 May;195(9):2087-100;Trends Microbiol. 2013 Feb;21(2):73-81;MBio. 2015 May 12;6(3):e00129-15;J Bacteriol. 1977 May;130(2):826-31;BMC Microbiol. 2005 May 23;5:30;J Bacteriol. 1969 Oct;100(1):276-82;Eur J Biochem. 1993 Feb 1;211(3):521-7;Microbiology. 2015 Nov;161(Pt 11):2232-42;J Bacteriol. 1995 Sep;177(17):4940-6;J Bacteriol. 2005 Feb;187(4):1246-53;J Bacteriol. 2014 Jul;196 (14 ):2543-51;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2014 Apr;27(4):364-78;J Biol Chem. 1968 Apr 10;243(7):1390-400;Arch Biochem Biophys. 1951 Jun;32(1):85-8;Gene. 1995 Dec 1;166(1):175-6;J Bacteriol. 2000 Feb;182(4):1053-61;Dev Biol. 1976 Jul 1;51(1):23-33;J Bacteriol. 2010 Jun;192(11):2722-8;J Bacteriol. 2003 Apr;185(7):2227-35;J Bacteriol. 2014 Jan;196(2):504-13;J Bacteriol. 1989 Sep;171(9):5095-102;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Nov 23;96(24):13904-9;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2000 Nov 1;192(1):107-12;J Bacteriol. 2011 Sep;193(17 ):4307-16;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Dec 21;96(26):15202-7;Infect Immun. 2007 Aug;75(8):3902-12	PubMed-not-MEDLINE	epublish

Nature communications	Nat Commun	2041-1723	The innate immune protein calprotectin promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus interaction.	Microorganisms form biofilms containing differentiated cell populations. To determine factors driving differentiation, we herein visualize protein and metal distributions within Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms using imaging mass spectrometry. These in vitro experiments reveal correlations between differential protein distribution and metal abundance. Notably, zinc- and manganese-depleted portions of the biofilm repress the production of anti-staphylococcal molecules. Exposure to calprotectin (a host protein known to sequester metal ions at infectious foci) recapitulates responses occurring within metal-deplete portions of the biofilm and promotes interaction between P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Consistent with these results, the presence of calprotectin promotes co-colonization of the murine lung, and polymicrobial communities are found to co-exist in calprotectin-enriched airspaces of a cystic fibrosis lung explant. These findings, which demonstrate that metal fluctuations are a driving force of microbial community structure, have clinical implications because of the frequent occurrence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus co-infections.	7		11951	10.1038/ncomms11951	Wakeman;Moore;Noto;Zhang;Singleton;Prentice;Gilston;Doster;Gaddy;Chazin;Caprioli;Skaar	Catherine A;Jessica L;Michael J;Yaofang;Marc D;Boone M;Benjamin A;Ryan S;Jennifer A;Walter J;Richard M;Eric P	Tennessee Valley Healthcare Systems, US Department of Veterans Affairs, Nashville, Tennessee 37212, USA.;Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Tennessee Valley Healthcare Systems, US Department of Veterans Affairs, Nashville, Tennessee 37212, USA.;Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.;Tennessee Valley Healthcare Systems, US Department of Veterans Affairs, Nashville, Tennessee 37212, USA.;Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.	eng	Chem Rev. 2013 Apr 10;113(4):2309-42;Infect Immun. 2010 May;78(5):1952-62;Anal Chem. 2011 Jul 15;83(14):5728-34;Methods Mol Biol. 2014;1149:293-301;J Pediatr. 2009 Feb;154(2):183-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 2016 Jan 4;44(D1):D447-56;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Jun 29;101(26):9792-7;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2012 Jul 16;10(8):525-37;Arch Dis Child. 1996 Feb;74(2):136-9;PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e56846;Infect Immun. 2013 Sep;81(9):3395-405;MBio. 2013 Aug 20;4(4):null;J Bacteriol. 2014 Apr;196(7):1335-42;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2014 Jun;19:45-51;J Bacteriol. 2015 Jul;197(14):2265-75;Mol Cell Proteomics. 2005 Apr;4(4):394-401;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2012 Jan;25(1):193-213;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;Anal Chim Acta. 2014 Jul 4;835:1-18;PLoS One. 2014 Mar 06;9(3):e89614;J Bacteriol. 2012 Nov;194(22):6023-8;Microbiology. 2010 Mar;156(Pt 3):678-86;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2000 Dec;64(4):847-67;Cell Host Microbe. 2011 Aug 18;10(2):158-64;Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2013 Apr 01;3(4):a010306;ISME J. 2016 Jun;10(6):1323-36;Anal Chem. 1997 Dec 1;69(23):4751-60;Trends Microbiol. 2014 Sep;22(9):508-16;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jan;187(2):554-66;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2013;67:629-50;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2013 Jun;79(11):3413-24;Curr Biol. 2006 Oct 24;16(20):2030-4;Science. 1995 Jun 30;268(5219):1899-902;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Aug 2;102(31):11076-81;J Bacteriol. 2015 Jul;197(14):2252-64;Infect Immun. 2009 Aug;77(8):3150-60;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Aug 21;109(34):13811-6;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Mar 5;110(10):3841-6;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Feb 12;110(7):2629-34;J Vis Exp. 2010 Dec 27;(46):null;PLoS Pathog. 2012;8(12):e1003068;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Aug 19;100(17):9912-7;PLoS One. 2014 Jan 23;9(1):e86705;Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2008;322:67-84;J Bacteriol. 2014 Jun;196(12):2265-76;Nat Commun. 2014 Oct 07;5:5105;Cell Host Microbe. 2013 May 15;13(5):509-19;J Bacteriol. 2003 Feb;185(4):1261-5;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Dec 26;103(52):19890-5;Science. 2008 Feb 15;319(5865):962-5;Syst Appl Microbiol. 2012 Dec;35(8):513-7;Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Feb;23(3):1034-43;Genes Dev. 2008 Apr 1;22(7):945-53;Biotechnol Bioeng. 1989 Jan 20;33(4):406-14;J Am Soc Mass Spectrom. 2015 Jun;26(6):873-7;Nature. 2006 May 18;441(7091):300-2;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2009 Apr;12(2):182-91;MBio. 2013 Feb 12;4(1):e00537-12;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2011 Jan;24(1):29-70;Methods Mol Biol. 2016;1397:279-89;J Immunol. 2005 Sep 15;175(6):3907-19;PLoS Pathog. 2015 Mar 04;11(3):e1004697;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8;Nat Chem Biol. 2015 Oct;11(10):765-71;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Nov 23;101(47):16630-5;Sci Transl Med. 2016 Mar 9;8(329):329ra31	MEDLINE	epublish
98	27301427	2016	06	15		Electronic	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	Scientific reports	Sci Rep	2045-2322	A proposed integrated approach for the preclinical evaluation of phage therapy in Pseudomonas infections.	Bacteriophage therapy is currently resurging as a potential complement/alternative to antibiotic treatment. However, preclinical evaluation lacks streamlined approaches. We here focus on preclinical approaches which have been implemented to assess bacteriophage efficacy against Pseudomonas biofilms and infections. Laser interferometry and profilometry were applied to measure biofilm matrix permeability and surface geometry changes, respectively. These biophysical approaches were combined with an advanced Airway Surface Liquid infection model, which mimics in vitro the normal and CF lung environments, and an in vivo Galleria larvae model. These assays have been implemented to analyze KTN4 (279,593 bp dsDNA genome), a type-IV pili dependent, giant phage resembling phiKZ. Upon contact, KTN4 immediately disrupts the P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm and reduces pyocyanin and siderophore production. The gentamicin exclusion assay on NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cell lines revealed the decrease of extracellular bacterial load between 4 and 7 logs and successfully prevents wild-type Pseudomonas internalization into CF epithelial cells. These properties and the significant rescue of Galleria larvae indicate that giant KTN4 phage is a suitable candidate for in vivo phage therapy evaluation for lung infection applications.	6		28115	10.1038/srep28115	Danis-Wlodarczyk;Vandenheuvel;Jang;Briers;Olszak;Arabski;Wasik;Drabik;Higgins;Tyrrell;Harvey;Noben;Lavigne;Drulis-Kawa	Katarzyna;Dieter;Ho Bin;Yves;Tomasz;Michal;Slawomir;Marcin;Gerard;Jean;Brian J;Jean-Paul;Rob;Zuzanna	Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Institute of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.;Laboratory of Gene Technology, KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Laboratory of Gene Technology, KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Laboratory of Gene Technology, KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Laboratory of Gene Technology, KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Laboratory of Applied Biotechnology, Department of Applied Biosciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.;Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Institute of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.;Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biology, The Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.;Department of Molecular Physics, Institute of Physics, The Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.;Department of Astrophysics, Institute of Physics, The Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.;National Children Research Centre, Dublin, Ireland.;Department of Molecular Medicine, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Education and Research Centre, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.;Department of Molecular Medicine, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Education and Research Centre, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.;Department of Molecular Medicine, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Education and Research Centre, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.;Biomedical Research Institute and Transnationale Universiteit Limburg, School of Life Sciences, Hasselt University, Diepenbeek, Belgium.;Laboratory of Gene Technology, KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Institute of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.	eng	Methods Mol Biol. 2009;501:141-9;Methods Mol Biol. 2014;1149:293-301;J Biol Phys. 2015 Sep;41(4):409-20;Mol Microbiol. 2012 Apr;84(2):324-39;MBio. 2012 Mar 06;3(2):e00029-12;Trends Microbiol. 2011 Aug;19(8):419-26;J Bacteriol. 2008 Feb;190(4):1429-35;J Appl Microbiol. 2011 Jan;110(1):106-17;Front Microbiol. 2011 Apr 05;2:65;Nat Protoc. 2008;3(10):1616-29;Nat Protoc. 2015 Jun;10(6):845-58;Nucleic Acids Res. 2015 Jan;43(Database issue):D213-21;Infect Immun. 1992 Feb;60(2):328-36;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2014 Dec;20(12):O983-90;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104;J Bacteriol. 2000 Sep;182(18):5114-20;Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Jan;38(Database issue):D57-61;Am J Infect Control. 2005 Jun;33(5 Suppl 1):S41-9;Infect Immun. 1992 Oct;60(10):3979-85;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):898-911;Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 Oct 3;374(4):747-51;Microbes Infect. 2000 Jul;2(9):1051-60;Microbiology. 2015 Oct;161(10):1961-77;Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 Jan 1;34(Database issue):D247-51;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2009 Jul 15;180(2):138-45;BMC Microbiol. 2009 Oct 26;9:224;J Proteome Res. 2014 Oct 3;13(10):4446-56;Trends Genet. 2000 Jun;16(6):276-7;Virology. 2012 Dec 20;434(2):251-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jul;39(Web Server issue):W29-37;Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2003 May;284(5):L844-54;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2874-83;Infect Immun. 1995 Oct;63(10):4072-7;RNA Biol. 2011 Jan-Feb;8(1):11-3;J Immunol. 2005 Mar 15;174(6):3643-9;Biochemistry (Mosc). 2006 Mar;71(3):300-5;J Pharm Sci. 2011 Dec;100(12):5197-205;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;Cell. 1998 Dec 23;95(7):1005-15;PLoS One. 2015 May 21;10(5):e0127603;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2015 Jul;99(14):6021-33;Curr Med Chem. 2015;22(14):1642-64;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Mar;45(3):649-59;Infect Immun. 1996 Feb;64(2):518-23;J Immunol. 2001 Jun 15;166(12):7410-8;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2011 Nov;66(11):2448-54;Mol Biol Evol. 2008 Apr;25(4):762-77;Virology. 2014 Nov;468-470:472-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Feb 15;26(4):1107-15;J Virol. 2014 Sep;88(18):10501-10;Can J Microbiol. 1984 Jun;30(6):758-62;Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Jun 15;29(12):2607-18;Arch Virol. 2007;152(10):1955-9;J Clin Invest. 2002 Feb;109 (3):317-25;Curr Protein Pept Sci. 2012 Dec;13(8):699-722;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2010 Feb;16(2):112-22;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Sep;61(5):1308-21;PLoS One. 2011 Feb 15;6(2):e16963;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Jul;49(2):277-300;Clin Otolaryngol. 2009 Aug;34(4):349-57;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W244-8;APMIS. 2006 Feb;114(2):131-8;J Virol. 2013 Dec;87(23):12866-78;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D38-51;Virol J. 2011 Mar 23;8:134;Arch Virol. 2014 Mar;159(3):567-72	MEDLINE	epublish

Bacterial outer membrane vesicle (OMV)-mediated delivery of proteins to host cells is an important mechanism of host-pathogen communication. Emerging evidence suggests that OMVs contain differentially packaged short RNAs (sRNAs) with the potential to target host mRNA function and/or stability. In this study, we used RNA-Seq to characterize differentially packaged sRNAs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa OMVs, and to show transfer of OMV sRNAs to human airway cells. We selected one sRNA for further study based on its stable secondary structure and predicted mRNA targets. Our candidate sRNA (sRNA52320), a fragment of a P. aeruginosa methionine tRNA, was abundant in OMVs and reduced LPS-induced as well as OMV-induced IL-8 secretion by cultured primary human airway epithelial cells. We also showed that sRNA52320 attenuated OMV-induced KC cytokine secretion and neutrophil infiltration in mouse lung. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that sRNA52320 in OMVs is a novel mechanism of host-pathogen interaction whereby P. aeruginosa reduces the host immune response.	12	6	e1005672	10.1371/journal.ppat.1005672	Koeppen;Hampton;Jarek;Scharfe;Gerber;Mielcarz;Demers;Dolben;Hammond;Hogan;Stanton	Katja;Thomas H;Michael;Maren;Scott A;Daniel W;Elora G;Emily L;John H;Deborah A;Bruce A	Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.;Genome Analytics Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany.;Genome Analytics Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany.;Departments of Genetics and Biochemistry, The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.;Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States of America.;Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States of America.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.	eng	J Bacteriol. 1995 Jul;177(14):3998-4008;J Bacteriol. 2012 Sep;194(17):4709-17;Genes (Basel). 2012 Oct 10;3(4):603-14;Cell Host Microbe. 2015 May 13;17(5):672-80;Microbes Infect. 2006 Aug;8(9-10):2400-8;PLoS Pathog. 2011 Mar;7(3):e1001325;Microbiology. 2004 Jul;150(Pt 7):2161-9;Proteomics. 2011 Sep;11(17):3572-7;Mol Microbiol. 2012 Feb;83(3):599-611;Genes Dev. 2005 Nov 15;19(22):2645-55;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Jan 22;110(4):1404-9;Nature. 2005 Sep 15;437(7057):422-5;Mol Cell. 2011 Sep 16;43(6):880-91;Biol Cell. 2009 Feb;101(2):117-31;Science. 2004 Mar 5;303(5663):1526-9;PLoS Pathog. 2009 Apr;5(4):e1000382;J Biol Chem. 2011 Jan 14;286(2):1269-76;Microbiologyopen. 2015 Jan 21;:null;PLoS Pathog. 2012 Sep;8(9):e1002945;PLoS One. 2015 Apr 21;10(4):e0123448;Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2014 Apr 1;306(7):L591-603;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jul 1;36(Web Server issue):W70-4;Mol Microbiol. 1992 Mar;6(6):729-34;J Biol Chem. 2007 Aug 17;282(33):24246-54;J Bacteriol. 1996 May;178(10):2767-74;J Biol Chem. 2014 Jan 3;289(1):152-62;J Bacteriol. 1998 Oct;180(20):5478-83;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2011 Jul;91(1):63-79;Anal Chem. 2013 Dec 17;85(24):11710-4;Exp Lung Res. 2006 May;32(5):181-99;Microbes Infect. 2011 Dec;13(14-15):1133-45;BMC Microbiol. 2009 Feb 03;9:26;PLoS One. 2014 Sep 03;9(9):e106434;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1990 Jun;56(6):1960-2;Mol Microbiol. 1998 May;28(4):675-81;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jun;42(11):7290-304;BMC Biol. 2014 Oct 01;12:78;Future Microbiol. 2014;9(9):1025-37;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jan 1;30(1):207-10;J Microbiol. 2014 Jun;52(6):482-9;Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2013 Oct;49(4):637-45;Environ Microbiol Rep. 2015 Apr;7(2):227-36;Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2014 Nov 12;4:162;Sci Rep. 2015 Oct 20;5:15329;Nat Methods. 2007 Mar;4(3):207-14;Genes Dev. 2009 Nov 15;23(22):2639-49;Res Microbiol. 2012 Nov-Dec;163(9-10):607-18;PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31092;Arch Med Res. 2008 Jan;39(1):33-9;Expert Rev Proteomics. 2012 Apr;9(2):129-34;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2006 Jul;72(7):5027-36;Methods Mol Biol. 2011;742:285-310;Infect Immun. 2010 Sep;78(9):3822-31;Nat Protoc. 2009;4(4):484-94;Traffic. 2015 Jun;16(6):555-71;Genome Biol. 2003;5(1):R1;Nat Protoc. 2006;1(1):153-61;Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):2006-16;Proteomics. 2013 Jan;13(1):22-4;Methods Mol Biol. 2013;945:109-21;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2010 Mar;74(1):81-94;Infect Immun. 2007 Aug;75(8):3902-12;PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36553	MEDLINE	epublish

Hemorrhagic pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains one of the most costly infectious diseases among farmed mink and commonly leads to large economic losses during mink production. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of using phages as a therapy against hemorrhagic pneumonia in mink. A broad-host-range phage from the Podoviridae family, YH30, was isolated using the mink-originating P. aeruginosa (serotype G) D7 strain as a host. The genome of YH30 was 72,192bp (54.92% G+C), contained 86 open reading frames and lacked regions encoding known virulence factors, integration-related proteins or antibiotic resistance determinants. These characteristics make YH30 eligible for use in phage therapy. The results of a curative treatment experiment demonstrated that a single intranasal administration of YH30 was sufficient to cure hemorrhagic pneumonia in mink. The mean colony count of P. aeruginosa in the blood and lung of YH30-protected mink was less than 10(3) CFU/mL (g) within 24h of bacterial challenge and ultimately became undetectable, whereas that in unprotected mink reached more than 10(8) CFU/mL (g). Additionally, YH30 dramatically improved the pathological manifestations of lung injury in mink with hemorrhagic pneumonia. Our work demonstrates the potential of phages to treat P. aeruginosa-caused hemorrhagic pneumonia in mink.	190		5-11	10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.03.016	Gu;Li;Yang;Du;Cui;Gong;Xia;Song;Zhang;Li;Yu;Sun;Feng;Lei;Han	Jingmin;Xinwei;Mei;Chongtao;Ziyin;Pengjuan;Feifei;Jun;Lei;Juecheng;Chuang;Changjiang;Xin;Liancheng;Wenyu	College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China.;College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, PR China; Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for the Prevention and Control of important Animal Infectious Disease and Zoonoses, Yangzhou 225009, PR China.

Multicellular organisms encounter environmental conditions that adversely affect protein homeostasis (proteostasis), including extreme temperatures, toxins, and pathogens. It is unclear how they use sensory signaling to detect adverse conditions and then activate stress response pathways so as to offset potential damage. Here, we show that dopaminergic mechanosensory neurons in C. elegans release the neurohormone dopamine to promote proteostasis in epithelia. Signaling through the DA receptor DOP-1 activates the expression of xenobiotic stress response genes involved in pathogenic resistance and toxin removal, and these genes are required for the removal of unstable proteins in epithelia. Exposure to a bacterial pathogen (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) results in elevated removal of unstable proteins in epithelia, and this enhancement requires DA signaling. In the absence of DA signaling, nematodes show increased sensitivity to pathogenic bacteria and heat-shock stress. Our results suggest that dopaminergic sensory neurons, in addition to slowing down locomotion upon sensing a potential bacterial feeding source, also signal to frontline epithelia to activate the xenobiotic stress response so as to maintain proteostasis and prepare for possible infection.	35	17	1885-901	10.15252/embj.201592524	Joshi;Matlack;Rongo	Kishore K;Tarmie L;Christopher	Department of Genetics, The Waksman Institute Rutgers The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA.;Department of Genetics, The Waksman Institute Rutgers The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA.;Department of Genetics, The Waksman Institute Rutgers The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA rongo@waksman.rutgers.edu.	eng	Curr Opin Chem Biol. 2013 Jun;17(3):346-52;Science. 2010 Dec 24;330(6012):1775-87;Trends Cell Biol. 2015 Jan;25(1):1-10;EMBO Rep. 2012 Sep;13(9):855-60;PLoS Genet. 2013;9(3):e1003346;Nat Commun. 2014 Dec 08;5:5659;Neurotox Res. 2014 Feb;25(2):153-60;Neuron. 2010 Aug 12;67(3):381-91;Nature. 2014 Aug 28;512(7515):400-5;Neuron. 2007 Aug 16;55(4):662-76;Exp Mol Med. 2015 Mar 13;47:e147;Nature. 2005 Jul 28;436(7050):510-7;Neurochem Int. 2013 Apr;62(5):803-19;Nat Biotechnol. 2000 May;18(5):538-43;Nature. 2012 Sep 13;489(7415):263-8;J Neurosci. 2014 Apr 23;34(17):5738-46;Mech Ageing Dev. 2008 Oct;129(10):611-3;Nat Biotechnol. 2003 Aug;21(8):897-902;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;Genetics. 1974 May;77(1):71-94;Biochem Pharmacol. 2014 Jul 1;90(1):1-6;Dev Cell. 2015 Feb 23;32(4):491-501;Mol Pharmacol. 1986 Feb;29(2):113-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1972 Aug;69(8):2145-9;J Biol Chem. 2008 Jan 4;283(1):194-201;Nature. 2014 Dec 18;516(7531):414-7;Cell. 2014 Oct 9;159(2):267-80;Cell Rep. 2014 Dec 24;9(6):2192-205;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jan;37(1):1-13;Cell Mol Life Sci. 2015 Feb;72(3):429-51;Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2008 Oct;1139:177-85;Pharmacol Rev. 2011 Mar;63(1):182-217;Nat Neurosci. 2004 Oct;7(10):1096-103;Neuron. 2000 Jun;26(3):619-31;Front Neurosci. 2014 May 22;8:113;J Biol Chem. 2009 May 15;284(20):13291-5;Mol Cell Neurosci. 2015 May;66(Pt A):53-61;J Intern Med. 2013 May;273(5):437-53;Genes Dev. 2005 Oct 1;19(19):2278-83;EMBO J. 2011 Jun 14;30(15):2990-3003;Dev Biol. 2003 Nov 1;263(1):81-102;Curr Biol. 2015 Jan 19;25(2):163-74;EMBO J. 2004 Jan 28;23(2):473-82;Dev Biol. 1999 Nov 15;215(2):314-31;J Biol Chem. 1995 Jul 21;270(29):17442-56;Genetics. 2011 Apr;187(4):1235-40;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Aug 6;99(16):10417-22;Metabolism. 2015 Mar;64(3 Suppl 1):S40-6;Nature. 2011 Feb 17;470(7334):404-8;Nature. 2003 Jul 17;424(6946):277-83;Genes Dev. 2014 Jul 15;28(14):1533-43;Nature. 2006 Mar 30;440(7084):684-7;J Biol Chem. 1988 Nov 5;263(31):16364-71;PLoS Pathog. 2013;9(12):e1003787;PLoS Pathog. 2014 May 29;10(5):e1004143;Mol Immunol. 2013 Sep;55(2):106-9;Mol Cell. 2009 May 15;34(3):259-69;CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets. 2010 Nov;9(5):526-38;Gene. 2001 Jan 24;263(1-2):103-12;Neuron. 1996 Jan;16(1):183-94;Cell. 2008 Jul 25;134(2):291-303;Science. 2008 May 9;320(5877):811-4;Cell. 2013 Jun 6;153(6):1366-78;Aging Cell. 2009 Jun;8(3):258-69;Mech Ageing Dev. 1980 Feb;12(2):137-50;PLoS Pathog. 2013;9(8):e1003433;PLoS One. 2013 Aug 16;8(8):e72578;Science. 2011 May 6;332(6030):729-32;Cell. 2013 Aug 1;154(3):676-90;Neuron. 2004 Dec 2;44(5):795-807;Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 2010 Aug;11(8):545-55;Nat Protoc. 2009;4(1):44-57;Science. 2003 May 16;300(5622):1142-5;Genes Dev. 2003 Aug 1;17(15):1882-93;J Exp Zool A Comp Exp Biol. 2006 Sep 1;305(9):720-30;Methods Mol Biol. 2008;415:403-27;Nature. 2011 Nov 16;480(7378):525-9;Drug Metab Rev. 2012 Aug;44(3):209-23;Aging Cell. 2009 Sep;8(5):524-41;Trends Cell Biol. 2013 Sep;23(9):409-20;Biochim Biophys Acta. 2014 Jan;1843(1):86-96;Int J Hyperthermia. 2013 Aug;29(5):442-7;PLoS Pathog. 2012;8(4):e1002673;BMC Cell Biol. 2007 Jul 30;8:32;Nature. 2003 Jan 16;421(6920):231-7;Development. 1999 Dec;126(24):5819-31	MEDLINE	ppublish

Microbiol.	1473-5644	Genetic environment of the KPC gene in Acinetobacter baumannii ST2 clone from Puerto Rico and genomic insights into its drug resistance.	Carbapenems are considered the last-resort antibiotics to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. The Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) enzyme hydrolyses β-lactam antibiotics including the carbapenems. KPC has been detected worldwide in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates associated with transposon Tn4401 commonly located in plasmids. Acinetobacter baumannii has become an important multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen. KPC-producing A. baumannii has been reported to date only in Puerto Rico. The objective of this study was to determine the whole genomic sequence of a KPC-producing A. baumannii in order to (i) define its allelic diversity, (ii) identify the location and genetic environment of the blaKPC and (iii) detect additional mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. Next-generation sequencing, Southern blot, PFGE, multilocus sequence typing and bioinformatics analysis were performed. The organism was assigned to the international ST2 clone. The blaKPC-2 was identified on a novel truncated version of Tn4401e (tentatively named Tn4401h), located in the chromosome within an IncA/C plasmid fragment derived from an Enterobacteriaceae, probably owing to insertion sequence IS26. A chromosomally located truncated Tn1 transposon harbouring a blaTEM-1 was found in a novel genetic environment within an antimicrobial resistance cluster. Additional resistance mechanisms included efflux pumps, non-β-lactam antibiotic inactivating enzymes within and outside a resistance island, two class 1 integrons, In439 and the novel In1252, as well as mutations in the topoisomerase and DNA gyrase genes which confer resistance to quinolones. The presence of the blaKPC in an already globally disseminated A. baumannii ST2 presents a serious threat of further dissemination.	65	8	784-792	10.1099/jmm.0.000289	Martinez;Martinez;Vazquez;Aquino;Robledo	Teresa;Idali;Guillermo J;Edna E;Iraida E	Department of Microbiology and Medical Zoology, School of Medicine, University of Puerto Rico, GPO Box 365067, San Juan, Puerto Rico.;Department of Microbiology and Medical Zoology, School of Medicine, University of Puerto Rico, GPO Box 365067, San Juan, Puerto Rico.;Department of Microbiology and Medical Zoology, School of Medicine, University of Puerto Rico, GPO Box 365067, San Juan, Puerto Rico.;Department of Microbiology and Medical Zoology, School of Medicine, University of Puerto Rico, GPO Box 365067, San Juan, Puerto Rico.;Department of Microbiology and Medical Zoology, School of Medicine, University of Puerto Rico, GPO Box 365067, San Juan, Puerto Rico.	eng	Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Nov;53(11):4930-3;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jul;39(Web Server issue):W347-52;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Oct;54(10):4168-77;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Mar;54(3):1354-7;J Microbiol Methods. 2005 Dec;63(3):219-28;J Clin Microbiol. 2010 Apr;48(4):1223-30;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Jan;57(1):269-76;Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 Jan 1;34(Database issue):D32-6;Jpn J Infect Dis. 2009 Sep;62(5):372-7;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Apr;53(4):1660-4;MBio. 2015 Jul 28;6(4):e01030;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2006 May;258(1):72-7;Ann Lab Med. 2014 Nov;34(6):433-8;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2012 Oct;67(10):2354-60;Plasmid. 2014 Jul;74:9-14;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Oct;53(10):4333-8;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2012 Nov;67(11):2640-4;J Clin Microbiol. 2006 Sep;44(9):3318-24;MBio. 2014 Jan 21;5(1):e00963-13;Microb Drug Resist. 2014 Dec;20(6):604-9;BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 Mar 08;11:119;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2006 Apr;27(4):351-3;Anal Biochem. 1995 Apr 10;226(2):235-40;Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 2014 Jun;79(2):255-60;Lancet Infect Dis. 2009 Apr;9(4):228-36;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2015 Feb;45(2):178-82;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Sep;54(9):3967-9;Infect Genet Evol. 2010 Oct;10(7):866-75;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2013 Jan;41(1):11-9;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Apr;56(4):2119-21;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2006 Feb;12(2):123-30;J Antibiot (Tokyo). 2015 May;68(5):313-7;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2013 Mar;68(3):554-7;J Bacteriol. 2009 Aug;191(15):4750-7;J Clin Microbiol. 2007 Oct;45(10):3352-9;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2011 Nov;17(11):E12-5;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Apr;45(4):1151-61;Genome Announc. 2015 Apr 09;3(2):null;Bioinformatics. 2009 Apr 15;25(8):1096-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007 Apr;51(4):1553-5;J Glob Infect Dis. 2010 Sep;2(3):291-304;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2008 Apr;52(4):1257-63;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2011 Jul;66(7):1499-503;Genome Announc. 2015 Jun 18;3(3):null;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2003 May;47(5):1536-42;Genome Res. 2004 Jul;14(7):1394-403;Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 1989 Sep;10(9):402-7;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 Nov;55(11):5350-3;MBio. 2015 Jun 09;6(3):e00762;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Jul 15;90(14):6874-8;J Med Microbiol. 2014 Dec;63(Pt 12):1644-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Jul;56(7):4032-4	MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections result in high morbidity and mortality rates for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), with premature death often occurring. These infections are complicated by the formation of biofilms in the sputum. Antibiotic therapy is stymied by antibiotic resistance of the biofilm matrix, making novel antibiofilm strategies highly desirable. Within P. aeruginosa biofilms, the redox factor pyocyanin enhances biofilm integrity by intercalating with extracellular DNA. The antioxidant glutathione (GSH) reacts with pyocyanin, disrupting intercalation. This study investigated GSH disruption by assaying the physiological effects of GSH and DNase I on biofilms of clinical CF isolates grown in CF artificial sputum medium (ASMDM+). Confocal scanning laser microscopy showed that 2 mM GSH, alone or combined with DNase I, significantly disrupted immature (24-h) biofilms of Australian epidemic strain (AES) isogens AES-1R and AES-1M. GSH alone greatly disrupted mature (72-h) AES-1R biofilms, resulting in significant differential expression of 587 genes, as indicated by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Upregulated systems included cyclic diguanylate and pyoverdine biosynthesis, the type VI secretion system, nitrate metabolism, and translational machinery. Biofilm disruption with GSH revealed a cellular physiology distinct from those of mature and dispersed biofilms. RNA-seq results were validated by biochemical and quantitative PCR assays. Biofilms of a range of CF isolates disrupted with GSH and DNase I were significantly more susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and increased antibiotic effectiveness was achieved by increasing the GSH concentration. This study demonstrated that GSH, alone or with DNase I, represents an effective antibiofilm treatment when combined with appropriate antibiotics, pending in vivo studies.	60	8	4539-51	10.1128/AAC.02919-15	Klare;Das;Ibugo;Buckle;Manefield;Manos	William;Theerthankar;Amaye;Edwina;Mike;Jim	Department of Infectious Disease and Immunology, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia william.klare@sydney.edu.au.;Department of Infectious Disease and Immunology, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia.;School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia.;Department of Infectious Disease and Immunology, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia.;Department of Infectious Disease and Immunology, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.	eng	PLoS Pathog. 2013;9(8):e1003526;Methods Mol Biol. 2014;1149:293-301;J Bacteriol. 2001 Feb;183(3):843-53;J Hosp Infect. 2004 Jun;57(2):105-11;J Bacteriol. 2008 Aug;190(15):5493-501;Bioinformatics. 2010 Jan 1;26(1):139-40;Infect Immun. 2005 Jun;73(6):3764-72;Environ Microbiol. 2006 Jan;8(1):165-77;Environ Microbiol. 2008 Sep;10(9):2331-43;J Bacteriol. 2009 Mar;191(6):1961-73;Dev Cell. 2002 Oct;3(4):593-603;Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2012 Dec;47(6):738-45;J Bacteriol. 2012 Apr;194(8):2062-73;MBio. 2015 Jul 28;6(4):e00767;J Bacteriol. 2009 Dec;191(23):7333-42;Sci Rep. 2015 Feb 11;5:8398;Science. 2002 Feb 22;295(5559):1487;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1999 Oct;65(10):4594-600;FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 2012 Nov;66(2):251-64;Environ Microbiol Rep. 2015 Jun;7(3):498-507;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Aug 2;102(31):11076-81;Nature. 2013 Apr 25;496(7446):508-12;Acta Biochim Pol. 2008;55(3):571-80;PLoS Pathog. 2008 Nov;4(11):e1000213;Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2012 Apr 19;367(1592):1102-11;PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e58299;J Bacteriol. 2004 Nov;186(21):7312-26;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 May;57(5):2352-61;Mol Microbiol. 2010 Feb;75(4):827-42;J Bacteriol. 2005 Sep;187(18):6571-6;Mol Microbiol. 1994 Sep;13(6):1071-7;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Sep;45(5):1277-87;Chem Biol Interact. 2015 May 5;232:30-7;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Dec;11(12):3073-86;Infect Immun. 2014 Aug;82(8):3417-25;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2003 Jan;47(1):317-23;Chem Biol. 2015 Feb 19;22(2):196-205;J Med Microbiol. 2010 Sep;59(Pt 9):1089-100;BMC Genomics. 2006 Jun 26;7:162;J Biol Chem. 2011 Apr 8;286(14):12317-27;Int Microbiol. 2010 Dec;13(4):207-12;Pediatr Pulmonol. 2002 Aug;34(2):91-100;Microbiology. 2008 Jun;154(Pt 6):1570-83;Microbiology. 2012 Feb;158(Pt 2):353-67;J Biol Chem. 2012 Aug 3;287(32):27095-105;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Sep;56(9):4976-9;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2006 Mar;72(3):2064-9;MBio. 2014 Sep 16;5(5):e01592-14;J Bacteriol. 2012 Jun;194(11):2904-15;Nat Commun. 2014 Jul 21;5:4462;Mol Microbiol. 2008 Jul;69(2):376-89;J Bacteriol. 2006 Nov;188(21):7344-53;J Bacteriol. 2005 Feb;187(4):1455-64;J Proteome Res. 2012 Feb 3;11(2):776-95;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2005 Jul;11 Suppl 4:17-32;PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31092;Methods Mol Biol. 2014;1149:643-51;Proc Biol Sci. 2013 Jun 12;280(1764):20131055;J Clin Invest. 2002 Feb;109 (3):317-25;Res Microbiol. 2010 Apr;161(3):187-91;PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24526;Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):1913-28;Environ Microbiol. 2011 Dec;13(12):3128-38;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2013 Jul 1;188(1):83-9;J Bacteriol. 2006 Sep;188(17):6361-75;J Proteome Res. 2015 Jan 2;14(1):72-81;PLoS Pathog. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000354;J Hosp Med. 2013 Oct;8(10):559-63;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Sep 8;112(36):11353-8;Environ Microbiol. 2011 Jul;13(7):1705-17;BMC Microbiol. 2010 Nov 17;10:294;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Jul;65(1):153-65;Genome Biol. 2014;15(12):550	MEDLINE	epublish

J.	1532-0987	High Prevalence of Antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative Colonization in Hospitalized Cambodian Infants.	Antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections are a significant cause of mortality in young infants. We aimed to determine characteristics of, and risk factors for, colonization and invasive infection caused by 3rd generation cephalosporin (3GC) or carbapenem-resistant organisms in outborn infants admitted to a neonatal unit (NU) in Cambodia.;During the first year of operation, patients admitted to the Angkor Hospital for Children NU, Siem Reap, Cambodia, underwent rectal swabbing on admission and twice weekly until discharge. Swabs were taken also from 7 environmental sites. Swabs were cultured to identify 3GC or carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.;The study included 333 infants with a median age at NU admission of 10 days (range, 0-43). Colonization by ≥1 3GC-resistant organism was detected in 85.9% (286/333). Admission swabs were collected in 289 infants: 61.9% were colonized by a 3GC-resistant organism at the time of admission, and a further 23.2% were colonized during hospitalization, at a median of 4 days [95% confidence interval: 3-5]. Probiotic treatment (hazard ratio: 0.58; 95% confidence interval: 0.35-0.98) was associated with delayed colonization. Colonization by a carbapenem-resistant organism occurred in 25 (7.5%) infants. Six infants had NU-associated K. pneumoniae bacteremia; phenotypically identical colonizing strains were found in 3 infants. Environmental colonization occurred early.;Colonization by antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative organisms occurred early in hospitalized Cambodian infants and was associated with subsequent invasive infection. Trials of potential interventions such as probiotics are needed.	35	8	856-61	10.1097/INF.0000000000001187	Turner;Pol;Soeng;Sar;Neou;Chea;Day;Cooper;Turner	Paul;Sreymom;Sona;Poda;Leakhena;Phal;Nicholas Pj;Ben S;Claudia	From the *Cambodia Oxford Medical Research Unit, Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, Cambodia; †Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; ‡Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; and §Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, Cambodia.	eng	J Perinatol. 2015 Oct;35(10):846-51;Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2009 Jan;28(1 Suppl):S10-8;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2015;70(6):1893-7;Neonatology. 2013;103(2):155-60;Early Hum Dev. 2011 Jun;87(6):391-9;Lancet Infect Dis. 2013 Dec;13(12):1057-98;Trop Med Int Health. 2011 Feb;16(2):145-51;Clin Infect Dis. 2004 Jul 15;39(2):219-26;BJOG. 2014 Jul;121(8):923-8;Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2002 Nov;21(11):1029-33;Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2013 Jul;32(7):e272-6;Trop Med Int Health. 2015 Jan;20(1):24-8;J Paediatr Child Health. 2012 Sep;48(9):777-83;Semin Perinatol. 2007 Feb;31(1):26-32;Lancet. 2005 Mar 26-Apr 1;365(9465):1175-88;J Med Microbiol. 2011 Nov;60(Pt 11):1651-60;Am J Infect Control. 2007 May;35(4):222-30;BMJ. 2014 Apr 01;348:g2107;Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2013 Dec;32(12):e443-50;Pediatr Infect Dis. 1986 Nov-Dec;5(6):663-8;J Med Microbiol. 2010 Aug;59(Pt 8):948-54;Am J Infect Control. 2012 Aug;40(6):512-5;Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed. 2013 May;98(3):F249-55;Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed. 2013 Nov;98(6):F549-53	MEDLINE	ppublish

Technol.	1520-5851	Determining Multiple Responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to an Antimicrobial Agent, Free Nitrous Acid.	Free nitrous acid (FNA) has recently been demonstrated as an antimicrobial agent on a range of micro-organisms, especially in wastewater-treatment systems. However, the antimicrobial mechanism of FNA is largely unknown. Here, we report that the antimicrobial effects of FNA are multitargeted. The response of a model denitrifier, Pseudomnas aeruginosa PAO1 (PAO1), common in wastewater treatment, was investigated in the absence and presence of inhibitory level of FNA (0.1 mg N/L) under anaerobic denitrifying conditions. This was achieved through coupling gene expression analysis, by RNA sequencing, and with a suite of physiological analyses. Various transcripts exhibited significant changes in abundance in the presence of FNA. Respiration was likely inhibited because denitrification activity was severely depleted, and decreased transcript levels of most denitrification genes occurred. As a consequence, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was inhibited due to the lowered cellular redox state in the FNA-exposed cultures. Meanwhile, during FNA exposure, PAO1 rerouted its carbon metabolic pathway from the TCA cycle to pyruvate fermentation with acetate as the end product as a possible survival mechanism. Additionally, protein synthesis was significantly decreased, and ribosome preservation was evident. These findings improve our understanding of PAO1 in response to FNA and contribute toward the potential application for use of FNA as an antimicrobial agent.	50	10	5305-12	10.1021/acs.est.6b00288	Gao;Fan;Peng;Guo;Agulló-Barceló;Yuan;Bond	Shu-Hong;Lu;Lai;Jianhua;Míriam;Zhiguo;Philip L	Advanced Water Management Centre, The University of Queensland , St. Lucia, Brisbane QLD 4072, Australia.;Advanced Water Management Centre, The University of Queensland , St. Lucia, Brisbane QLD 4072, Australia.;iCarbonX , Shenzhen 518053, China.;Advanced Water Management Centre, The University of Queensland , St. Lucia, Brisbane QLD 4072, Australia.;Laboratory of Microbial Ecology and Technology (LabMET), Ghent University , Coupure Links 653, Ghent 9000, Belgium.;Advanced Water Management Centre, The University of Queensland , St. Lucia, Brisbane QLD 4072, Australia.;Advanced Water Management Centre, The University of Queensland , St. Lucia, Brisbane QLD 4072, Australia.;Advanced Water Management Centre, The University of Queensland , St. Lucia, Brisbane QLD 4072, Australia.;Advanced Water Management Centre, The University of Queensland , St. Lucia, Brisbane QLD 4072, Australia.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Many bacteria produce extracellular and surface-associated components such as membrane vesicles (MVs), extracellular DNA and moonlighting cytosolic proteins for which the biogenesis and export pathways are not fully understood. Here we show that the explosive cell lysis of a sub-population of cells accounts for the liberation of cytosolic content in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that explosive cell lysis also produces shattered membrane fragments that rapidly form MVs. A prophage endolysin encoded within the R- and F-pyocin gene cluster is essential for explosive cell lysis. Endolysin-deficient mutants are defective in MV production and biofilm development, consistent with a crucial role in the biogenesis of MVs and liberation of extracellular DNA and other biofilm matrix components. Our findings reveal that explosive cell lysis, mediated through the activity of a cryptic prophage endolysin, acts as a mechanism for the production of bacterial MVs.	7		11220	10.1038/ncomms11220	Turnbull;Toyofuku;Hynen;Kurosawa;Pessi;Petty;Osvath;Cárcamo-Oyarce;Gloag;Shimoni;Omasits;Ito;Yap;Monahan;Cavaliere;Ahrens;Charles;Nomura;Eberl;Whitchurch	Lynne;Masanori;Amelia

The invertebrate immune system comprises physiological mechanisms, physical barriers and also behavioral responses. It is generally related to the vertebrate innate immune system and widely believed to provide nonspecific defense against pathogens, whereby the response to different pathogen types is usually mediated by distinct signalling cascades. Recent work suggests that invertebrate immune defense can be more specific at least at the phenotypic level. The underlying genetic mechanisms are as yet poorly understood.;We demonstrate in the model invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans that a single gene, a homolog of the mammalian neuropeptide Y receptor gene, npr-1, mediates contrasting defense phenotypes towards two distinct pathogens, the Gram-positive Bacillus thuringiensis and the Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our findings are based on combining quantitative trait loci (QTLs) analysis with functional genetic analysis and RNAseq-based transcriptomics. The QTL analysis focused on behavioral immune defense against B. thuringiensis, using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and introgression lines (ILs). It revealed several defense QTLs, including one on chromosome X comprising the npr-1 gene. The wildtype N2 allele for the latter QTL was associated with reduced defense against B. thuringiensis and thus produced an opposite phenotype to that previously reported for the N2 npr-1 allele against P. aeruginosa. Analysis of npr-1 mutants confirmed these contrasting immune phenotypes for both avoidance behavior and nematode survival. Subsequent transcriptional profiling of C. elegans wildtype and npr-1 mutant suggested that npr-1 mediates defense against both pathogens through p38 MAPK signaling, insulin-like signaling, and C-type lectins. Importantly, increased defense towards P. aeruginosa seems to be additionally influenced through the induction of oxidative stress genes and activation of GATA transcription factors, while the repression of oxidative stress genes combined with activation of Ebox transcription factors appears to enhance susceptibility to B. thuringiensis.;Our findings highlight the role of a single gene, npr-1, in fine-tuning nematode immune defense, showing the ability of the invertebrate immune system to produce highly specialized and potentially opposing immune responses via single regulatory genes.	17		280	10.1186/s12864-016-2603-8	Nakad;Snoek;Yang;Ellendt;Schneider;Mohr;Rösingh;Masche;Rosenstiel;Dierking;Kammenga;Schulenburg	Rania;L Basten;Wentao;Sunna;Franziska;Timm G;Lone;Anna C;Philip

A carbapenem-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, NCGM1984, was isolated in 2012 from a hospitalized patient in Japan. Immunochromatographic assay showed that the isolate was positive for IMP-type metallo-β-lactamase. Complete genome sequencing revealed that NCGM1984 harbored two copies of blaIMP-34, located at different sites on the chromosome. Each blaIMP-34 was present in the same structures of the class 1 integrons, tnpA(ISPa7)-intI1-qacG-blaIMP-34-aac(6')-Ib-qacEdelta1-sul1-orf5-tniBdelta-tniA. The isolate belonged to multilocus sequence typing ST235, one of the international high-risk clones. IMP-34, with an amino acid substitution (Glu126Gly) compared with IMP-1, hydrolyzed all β-lactamases tested except aztreonam, and its catalytic activities were similar to IMP-1. This is the first report of a clinical isolate of an IMP-34-producing P. aeruginosa harboring two copies of blaIMP-34 on its chromosome.	11	4	e0149385	10.1371/journal.pone.0149385	Tada;Miyoshi-Akiyama;Shimada;Shiroma;Nakano;Teruya;Satou;Hirano;Shimojima;Kirikae	Tatsuya;Tohru;Kayo;Akino;Kazuma;Kuniko;Kazuhito;Takashi;Masahiro;Teruo	Department of Infectious Diseases, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.;Department of Infectious Diseases, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.;Pathogenic Microbe Laboratory, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.;Department of Infectious Diseases, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.;Research and Development Division, Okinawa Institute of Advanced Sciences, Uruma, Okinawa, Japan.;Research and Development Division, Okinawa Institute of Advanced Sciences, Uruma, Okinawa, Japan.;Research and Development Division, Okinawa Institute of Advanced Sciences, Uruma, Okinawa, Japan.;Research and Development Division, Okinawa Institute of Advanced Sciences, Uruma, Okinawa, Japan.;Research and Development Division, Okinawa Institute of Advanced Sciences, Uruma, Okinawa, Japan.;Department of Accuracy Management, BML Inc., Kawagoe, Saitama, Japan.;Department of Infectious Diseases, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.	eng	Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1998 Apr;42(4):921-6;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1995 Jan;39(1):155-62;N Engl J Med. 2005 Jan 27;352(4):380-91;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2005 Apr;18(2):306-25;J Biol Chem. 2005 May 27;280(21):20824-32;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Jan;53(1):277-80;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Jan;54(1):565-9;PLoS Genet. 2010 Jan;6(1):e1000793;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Mar;54(3):969-76;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010 Jul;65(7):1382-6;J Microbiol Methods. 2011 Dec;87(3):330-7;J Microbiol Methods. 2012 Oct;91(1):114-6;Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 2013 May;76(1):119-21;J Clin Microbiol. 2013 Jun;51(6):1762-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Jul;57(7):3405-7;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Sep;57(9):4427-32;Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 2014 Mar;105(3):613-8;J Infect Chemother. 2014 Sep;20(9):586-8;BMC Microbiol. 2015;15:41;Drug Resist Updat. 2015 Jul-Aug;21-22:41-59;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2015 Nov;59(11):7090-3;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2000 Jun;44(6):1538-43;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Apr;45(4):1263-70;Clin Infect Dis. 2001 Apr 1;32(7):1085-9;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Aug;45(8):2263-8;J Bacteriol. 1977 Dec;132(3):912-22;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1999 Jan;43(1):62-6	MEDLINE	epublish

Phage therapy requires the comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the host-phage interactions. In this work, to identify the genes related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage K8 receptor synthesis, 16 phage-resistant mutants were selected from a Tn5G transposon mutant library of strain PAK. The disrupted genetic loci were identified and they were related to O-specific antigen (OSA) synthesis, including gene wbpR, ssg, wbpV, wbpO, and Y880_RS05480, which encoded a putative O-antigen polymerase Wzy. The Lipopolysaccharide profile of the Y880_RS05480 mutant was analyzed and shown to lack the O-antigen. Therefore, the data from characterization of Y880_RS05480 by TMHMM and SDS-PAGE silver staining analysis suggest that this locus might encode Wzy. The complete phage K8 genome was characterized as 93879 bp in length and contained identical 1188-bp terminal direct repeats. Comparative genomic analysis showed that phage K8 was highly homologous to members of the genus PaP1-like phages. On the basis of our genetic findings, OSA of P. aeruginosa PAK is proven to be the receptor of phage K8. The highly conserved structural proteins among the genetic closely related phages suggest that they may recognize the same receptor.	7		252	10.3389/fmicb.2016.00252	Pan;Cui;Zhang;He;Li;Yang	Xuewei;Xiaoli;Fenjiao;Yang;Lingyan;Hongjiang	Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology Tianjin, China.;Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology Tianjin, China.;Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology Tianjin, China.;Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology Tianjin, China.;Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology Tianjin, China.;Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology Tianjin, China.	eng	Appl Environ Microbiol. 2012 Sep;78(17):6380-5;Res Microbiol. 2008 Jun;159(5):349-57;J Bacteriol. 2006 Oct;188(19):6924-31;Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces. 2015 Mar 1;127:182-91;J Mol Biol. 2001 Jan 19;305(3):567-80;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2011 Feb;315(1):38-45;BMC Microbiol. 2011 May 14;11:102;J Bacteriol. 1990 Apr;172(4):1899-904;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Jan 1;89(1):47-51;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009 Oct;22(4):582-610;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Jan;57(1):110-9;Virology. 2006 Feb 20;345(2):540-8;PLoS One. 2014 Jan 20;9(1):e85806;J Clin Microbiol. 1990 Dec;28(12):2627-31;PLoS One. 2013 May 13;8(5):e62933;Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2010 Jan;11(1):69-86;Bioinformatics. 2009 Jan 1;25(1):119-20;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):821-9;J Bacteriol. 1983 Jul;155(1):203-12;Mol Biol Evol. 2011 Oct;28(10):2731-9;J Bacteriol. 1992 Apr;174(7):2407-11;Can J Microbiol. 2014 Nov;60(11):697-716;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2002 Jun;68(6):2950-8;J Bacteriol. 2014 Apr;196(7):1306-17;PLoS One. 2015 Jun 26;10(6):e0130548;Future Microbiol. 2010 Jul;5(7):1041-55;J Pharm Pharmacol. 1974 Nov;26(11):900-2;Bioinformatics. 2014 Aug 1;30(15):2114-20;J Virol. 1985 Oct;56(1):268-76;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2003 Mar;67(1):86-156, table of contents;J Biol Chem. 2000 Jun 23;275(25):19060-7;Virology. 1995 Jan 10;206(1):611-25;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Aug;73(3):434-45;Gene. 1991 Jan 2;97(1):109-21;Curr Microbiol. 1999 Apr;38(4):239-43;J Bacteriol. 2001 Mar;183(6):1928-37;Cell Microbiol. 2007 Feb;9(2):479-91;Clin Microbiol Rev. 1993 Oct;6(4):428-42;J Biol Chem. 2000 Oct 27;275(43):33252-9;J Bacteriol. 1994 Sep;176(17):5262-9;PLoS One. 2015 Jan 28;10(1):e0117163;Microbiology. 1999 Dec;145 ( Pt 12):3505-21;PLoS One. 2014 Apr 03;9(4):e93777;Microbios. 1986;45(183):81-91;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Sep 17;93(19):10434-9;BMC Microbiol. 2010 Apr 29;10:131;Future Microbiol. 2013 Jun;8(6):769-83;Gene. 1997 Dec 19;204(1-2):201-12;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(3):1184-7;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2012 Jun;78(12):4510-5;Arch Microbiol. 1983 Aug;135(2):155-7;Can J Microbiol. 2010 Nov;56(11):925-33;Mol Biol Evol. 2007 Oct;24(10):2169-79;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jan 1;31(1):28-33;Genome Announc. 2013 Sep 05;1(5):null;Genome Announc. 2013 Oct 10;1(5):null;J Virol. 2012 Jun;86(11):6369-70;Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2014 Jul;15(10):1351-70;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 1999 Sep;63(3):523-53;Genome Res. 2004 Jul;14(7):1394-403;J Virol. 2006 Sep;80(18):9326-30;Front Microbiol. 2011 Jun 01;2:118;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W686-9;PLoS One. 2013 Apr 24;8(4):e60575	PubMed-not-MEDLINE	epublish
113	26962050	2016	Mar			Print	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	Open biology	Open Biol	2046-2441	Genomic islands 1 and 2 play key roles in the evolution of extensively drug-resistant ST235 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa are noscomially acquired, opportunistic pathogens that pose a major threat to the health of burns patients and the immunocompromised. We sequenced the genomes of P. aeruginosa isolates RNS_PA1, RNS_PA46 and RNS_PAE05, which displayed resistance to almost all frontline antibiotics, including gentamicin, piperacillin, timentin, meropenem, ceftazidime and colistin. We provide evidence that the isolates are representatives of P. aeruginosa sequence type (ST) 235 and carry Tn6162 and Tn6163 in genomic islands 1 (GI1) and 2 (GI2), respectively. GI1 disrupts the endA gene at precisely the same chromosomal location as in P. aeruginosa strain VR-143/97, of unknown ST, creating an identical CA direct repeat. The class 1 integron associated with Tn6163 in GI2 carries a blaGES-5-aacA4-gcuE15-aphA15 cassette array conferring resistance to carbapenems and aminoglycosides. GI2 is flanked by a 12 nt direct repeat motif, abuts a tRNA-gly gene, and encodes proteins with putative roles in integration, conjugative transfer as well as integrative conjugative element-specific proteins. This suggests that GI2 may have evolved from a novel integrative conjugative element. Our data provide further support to the hypothesis that genomic islands play an important role in de novo evolution of multiple antibiotic resistance phenotypes in P. aeruginosa.	6	3		10.1098/rsob.150175	Roy Chowdhury;Scott;Worden;Huntington;Hudson;Karagiannis;Charles;Djordjevic	Piklu;Martin;Paul;Peter;Bernard;Thomas;Ian G;Steven P	The ithree institute, Faculty of Science, University of Technology, Sydney, PO Box 123, Broadway, New South Wales 2007, Australia Department of Primary Industries, Elizabeth Macarthur Agriculture Institute, PMB 4008, Camden, New South Wales 2567, Australia piklu.bhattacharya@uts.edu.au.;The ithree institute, Faculty of Science, University of Technology, Sydney, PO Box 123, Broadway, New South Wales 2007, Australia.;The ithree institute, Faculty of Science, University of Technology, Sydney, PO Box 123, Broadway, New South Wales 2007, Australia.;Pathology North, The Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, New South Wales 2065, Australia.;Pathology North, The Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, New South Wales 2065, Australia.;SEALS Department of Microbiology, Level 4, Campus Centre Prince of Wales Hospital, Baker Street, Randwick, New South Wales 2031, Australia.;The ithree institute, Faculty of Science, University of Technology, Sydney, PO Box 123, Broadway, New South Wales 2007, Australia.;The ithree institute, Faculty of Science, University of Technology, Sydney, PO Box 123, Broadway, New South Wales 2007, Australia steven.djordjevic@uts.edu.au.	eng	Genomics. 2008 Jun;91(6):530-7;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2009 Jul;64(1):46-51;PeerJ. 2014 Jan 09;2:e243;Intensive Care Med. 2007 Jul;33(7):1155-61;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Apr;56(4):2169-72;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2012 Jul;67(7):1799-800;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Oct 17;103(42):15605-10;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2013 Oct;42(4):301-6;Mol Biol Evol. 2014 May;31(5):1077-88;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009 Oct;22(4):582-610;BMC Bioinformatics. 2010;11:595;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:75;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2011 Sep;35(5):736-55;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2013 Mar;68(3):722-4;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jan;42(Database issue):D206-14;J Clin Microbiol. 2010 Jul;48(7):2563-4;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2005 Sep 1;250(1):71-6;BMC Infect Dis. 2013;13:505;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2011 Dec;66(12):2791-6;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2012 Jun;39(6):518-21;J Infect Dis. 2003 Dec 1;188(11):1695-706;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2012 Apr;39(4):300-4;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2012 Feb;67(2):357-61;Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2014 Jul;33(7):1181-7;Infect Immun. 1994 Apr;62(4):1320-7;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Dec;53(12):5294-6;Microbiology. 2001 Oct;147(Pt 10):2659-69;J Clin Microbiol. 1996 May;34(5):1129-35;Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999 Dec 23;1489(2-3):445-51;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010 May;65(5):866-71;PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e44199;Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 2014 Mar;78(3):271-6;J Bacteriol. 2011 Dec;193(24):7010;J Infect. 2010 Dec;61(6):511-2;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;PLoS One. 2010;5(6):e11147;J Hosp Infect. 2009 Dec;73(4):338-44;BMC Genomics. 2011;12:402;Microbiology. 2006 Jan;152(Pt 1):29-42;Front Microbiol. 2014 Nov 26;5:643;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2015 Mar;59(3):1583-7;Virulence. 2010 Jul-Aug;1(4):260-72;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Jan;57(1):410-6;PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e29113;Clin Lab Sci. 2011 Winter;24(1):41-2;Drugs. 2007;67(3):351-68;Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res. 2010 Aug;10(4):441-51;BMC Infect Dis. 2006;6:130;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2013 Dec;68(12):2820-4;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2005 Apr;18(2):306-25;Gut Pathog. 2014 Feb 24;6(1):4;PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e42304;Clin Lab Sci. 2011 Winter;24(1):43-6	MEDLINE	ppublish

116	26915971	2016	Feb	26		Electronic	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	Scientific reports	Sci Rep	2045-2322	Functional modules of sigma factor regulons guarantee adaptability and evolvability.	The focus of modern molecular biology turns from assigning functions to individual genes towards understanding the expression and regulation of complex sets of molecules. Here, we provide evidence that alternative sigma factor regulons in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa largely represent insulated functional modules which provide a critical level of biological organization involved in general adaptation and survival processes. Analysis of the operational state of the sigma factor network revealed that transcription factors functionally couple the sigma factor regulons and significantly modulate the transcription levels in the face of challenging environments. The threshold quality of newly evolved transcription factors was reached faster and more robustly in in silico testing when the structural organization of sigma factor networks was taken into account. These results indicate that the modular structures of alternative sigma factor regulons provide P. aeruginosa with a robust framework to function adequately in its environment and at the same time facilitate evolutionary change. Our data support the view that widespread modularity guarantees robustness of biological networks and is a key driver of evolvability.	6		22212	10.1038/srep22212	Binder;Eckweiler;Schulz;Bielecka;Nicolai;Franke;Häussler;Meyer-Hermann	Sebastian C;Denitsa;Sebastian;Agata;Tanja;Raimo;Susanne;Michael	Department of Systems Immunology and Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.;Institute for Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Center for Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, 30265 Hannover, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.;Institute for Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Center for Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, 30265 Hannover, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.;Institute for Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Center for Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, 30265 Hannover, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.;Department of Chemical Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.;Institute for Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Center for Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, 30265 Hannover, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.;Department of Systems Immunology and Braunschweig Integrated Centre of Systems Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.;Institute for Biochemistry, Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Technische Universität Braunschweig, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.	eng	Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;MBio. 2015;6(4):e00749;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2001 Jun 12;200(1):73-8;J Bacteriol. 2001 Dec;183(24):7126-34;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Mar 5;99(5):3159-64;Mol Cell. 2002 Mar;9(3):527-39;Science. 2002 May 17;296(5571):1280-4;Burns. 2002 Jun;28(4):340-8;J Bacteriol. 2003 Apr;185(7):2066-79;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Nov;50(3):809-24;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Feb;51(4):973-85;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2004 Jan;2(1):57-65;Nature. 1969 Jan 4;221(5175):43-6;Annu Rev Genet. 1986;20:567-91;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Mar;86(6):1954-7;J Bacteriol. 1989 Aug;171(8):4326-33;Nature. 1999 Dec 2;402(6761 Suppl):C47-52;Trends Microbiol. 2000 Feb;8(2):55-7;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2000 May 1;186(1):1-9;Science. 2000 May 19;288(5469):1251-4;J Bacteriol. 2000 Jun;182(12):3498-507;J Bacteriol. 2000 Aug;182(15):4356-60;Microbes Infect. 2000 Jul;2(9):1051-60;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Mol Microbiol. 2001 May;40(4):917-31;Mol Microbiol. 1992 Feb;6(4):459-69;Cell. 1996 Oct 4;87(1):127-36;Bioinformatics. 2005 Apr 1;21(7):1154-63;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2005 Jun 1;171(11):1209-23;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8;Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2006 Sep;13(9):806-14;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007 Apr;51(4):1455-62;J Bacteriol. 2007 Aug;189(15):5413-20;BMC Genomics. 2007;8:287;Nat Rev Genet. 2007 Dec;8(12):921-31;PLoS Comput Biol. 2008 Feb;4(2):e23;Mol Microbiol. 2010 Oct;78(1):158-72;J Bacteriol. 2011 Feb;193(4):918-31;Genome Res. 2011 Jun;21(6):936-9;PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31092;Science. 2012 Mar 2;335(6072):1103-6;J Bacteriol. 2012 Aug;194(16):4301-11;PLoS Genet. 2012;8(8):e1002867;BMC Genomics. 2012;13:679;Nat Commun. 2013;4:1755;Nat Commun. 2013;4:2572;PLoS One. 2013;8(11):e80407;J Bacteriol. 2014 Jan;196(2):345-56;PLoS One. 2013;8(12):e84775;BMC Biol. 2014;12:4;J Immunol. 2014 Dec 1;193(11):5414-9;PLoS Pathog. 2015 Mar;11(3):e1004744;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Jun;40(5):1215-26	MEDLINE	epublish

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	1091-6490	SutA is a bacterial transcription factor expressed during slow growth in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	Microbial quiescence and slow growth are ubiquitous physiological states, but their study is complicated by low levels of metabolic activity. To address this issue, we used a time-selective proteome-labeling method [bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT)] to identify proteins synthesized preferentially, but at extremely low rates, under anaerobic survival conditions by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One of these proteins is a transcriptional regulator that has no homology to any characterized protein domains and is posttranscriptionally up-regulated during survival and slow growth. This small, acidic protein associates with RNA polymerase, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing suggests that the protein associates with genomic DNA through this interaction. ChIP signal is found both in promoter regions and throughout the coding sequences of many genes and is particularly enriched at ribosomal protein genes and in the promoter regions of rRNA genes. Deletion of the gene encoding this protein affects expression of these and many other genes and impacts biofilm formation, secondary metabolite production, and fitness in fluctuating conditions. On the basis of these observations, we have designated the protein SutA (survival under transitions A).	113	5	E597-605	10.1073/pnas.1514412113	Babin;Bergkessel;Sweredoski;Moradian;Hess;Newman;Tirrell	Brett M;Megan;Michael J;Annie;Sonja;Dianne K;David A	Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125;;Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125; Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125;;Proteome Exploration Laboratory, Beckman Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125.;Proteome Exploration Laboratory, Beckman Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125.;Proteome Exploration Laboratory, Beckman Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125.;Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125; Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125; dkn@caltech.edu tirrell@caltech.edu.;Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125; dkn@caltech.edu tirrell@caltech.edu.	eng	Methods Enzymol. 2011;498:349-61;J Bacteriol. 2011 Jun;193(12):3090-9;Microbiology. 2011 Jul;157(Pt 7):1945-54;Genome Res. 2011 Sep;21(9):1487-97;MBio. 2014;5(2):e00956-13;Genome Biol. 2009;10(3):R25;J Infect Dis. 2009 Jul 1;200(1):118-30;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Jul;73(1):120-36;Bioinformatics. 2009 Aug 15;25(16):2078-9;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Sep;73(6):1072-85;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2009 Dec;12(6):674-82;J Bacteriol. 2010 Jan;192(1):365-9;Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2009;48(52):9879-83;Microbiology. 2010 Feb;156(Pt 2):431-41;BMC Biol. 2010;8:49;Proteomics. 2012 Jan;12(1):21-31;Nat Methods. 2012 Jul;9(7):671-5;Bioinformatics. 2012 Oct 1;28(19):2532-3;PLoS Pathog. 2012 Sep;8(9):e1002945;J Bacteriol. 2013 Apr;195(7):1371-80;J Biol Chem. 2013 Jul 19;288(29):21055-64;Environ Microbiol Rep. 2013 Oct;5(5):679-85;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jan 7;111(1):433-8;Mol Cell. 2014 Mar 6;53(5):766-78;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Mol Cell. 2011 Sep 16;43(6):880-91;Mol Microbiol. 2003 May;48(4):855-61;BMC Bioinformatics. 2003 Sep 11;4:41;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jul;186(14):4596-604;Trends Microbiol. 2001 Apr;9(4):164-8;Mol Microbiol. 2014 Apr;92(2):399-412;Mol Cell Proteomics. 2014 May;13(5):1352-8;Bioinformatics. 2014 Aug 1;30(15):2114-20;Genome Biol. 2014;15(2):R29;Mol Microbiol. 2014 Sep;93(6):1130-43;MBio. 2015;6(4):e00767;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Jan 12;113(2):E110-6;Cell. 2004 Aug 6;118(3):297-309;Cell. 2004 Aug 6;118(3):311-22;J Bacteriol. 1984 Dec;160(3):928-34;J Mol Biol. 1995 Sep 15;252(2):189-202;Trends Mol Med. 2004 Dec;10(12):599-606;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2004 Dec;68(4):639-68;Mol Microbiol. 2005 May;56(4):1087-102;Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 Jan 1;34(Database issue):D394-7;J Bacteriol. 2006 Jan;188(2):659-68;Nat Biotechnol. 2006 Jan;24(1):79-88;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(3):1049-59;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jun 20;103(25):9482-7;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2006 Jul;72(7):5027-36;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Sep;61(5):1308-21;Nat Protoc. 2006;1(1):153-61;Nat Protoc. 2007;2(3):532-40;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Jul;65(1):153-65;Nat Protoc. 2007;2(8):1879-83;Nat Protoc. 2007;2(8):1896-906;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2008 Jan;32(1):38-55;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2008 Mar;6(3):199-210;Nat Biotechnol. 2008 Dec;26(12):1367-72;Mol Cell. 2009 Jan 16;33(1):97-108;Nat Protoc. 2009;4(4):484-94;Cell. 2010 May 14;141(4):595-605;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jun;12(6):1719-33;J Am Chem Soc. 2010 Dec 29;132(51):18351-60;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;Mol Microbiol. 2011 Feb;79(3):700-15;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Apr 5;108(14):5712-7	MEDLINE	ppublish
123	26714629	2015	Dec	29		Electronic	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	BMC genomics	BMC Genomics	1471-2164	Comparative genomics and biological characterization of sequential Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from persistent airways infection.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa establishes life-long chronic airway infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. As the disease progresses, P. aeruginosa pathoadaptive variants are distinguished from the initially acquired strain. However, the genetic basis and the biology of host-bacteria interactions leading to a persistent lifestyle of P. aeruginosa are not understood. As a model system to study long term and persistent CF infections, the P. aeruginosa RP73, isolated 16.9 years after the onset of airways colonization from a CF patient, was investigated. Comparisons with strains RP1, isolated at the onset of the colonization, and clonal RP45, isolated 7 years before RP73 were carried out to better characterize genomic evolution of P. aeruginosa in the context of CF pathogenicity.;Virulence assessments in disease animal model, genome sequencing and comparative genomics analysis were performed for clinical RP73, RP45, RP1 and prototype strains. In murine model, RP73 showed lower lethality and a remarkable capability of long-term persistence in chronic airways infection when compared to other strains. Pathological analysis of murine lungs confirmed advanced chronic pulmonary disease, inflammation and mucus secretory cells hyperplasia. Genomic analysis predicted twelve genomic islands in the RP73 genome, some of which distinguished RP73 from other prototype strains and corresponded to regions of genome plasticity. Further, comparative genomic analyses with sequential RP isolates showed signatures of pathoadaptive mutations in virulence factors potentially linked to the development of chronic infections in CF.;The genome plasticity of P. aeruginosa particularly in the RP73 strain strongly indicated that these alterations may form the genetic basis defining host-bacteria interactions leading to a persistent lifestyle in human lungs.	16		1105	10.1186/s12864-015-2276-8	Bianconi;Jeukens;Freschi;Alcalá-Franco;Facchini;Boyle;Molinaro;Kukavica-Ibrulj;Tümmler;Levesque;Bragonzi	Irene;Julie;Luca;Beatriz;Marcella;Brian;Antonio;Irena;Burkhard;Roger C;Alessandra	Infections and Cystic Fibrosis Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy. bianconi.irene@hsr.it.;Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Quebec, Canada. julie.jeukens.1@ulaval.ca.;Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Quebec, Canada. luca.freschi@bio.ulaval.ca.;Infections and Cystic Fibrosis Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy. alcalafranco.beatriz@hsr.it.;Infections and Cystic Fibrosis Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy. facchini.marcella@hsr.it.;Institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes (IBIS), Université Laval, Quebec, Canada.

Microbiol.	1466-5034	Pseudomonas helleri sp. nov. and Pseudomonas weihenstephanensis sp. nov., isolated from raw cow's milk.	Analysis of the microbiota of raw cow's milk and semi-finished milk products yielded seven isolates assigned to the genus Pseudomonas that formed two individual groups in a phylogenetic analysis based on partial rpoD and 16S rRNA gene sequences. The two groups could be differentiated from each other and also from their closest relatives as well as from the type species Pseudomonas aeruginosa by phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization and average nucleotide identity (ANIb) values calculated from draft genome assemblies. ANIb values within the groups were higher than 97.3 %, whereas similarity values to the closest relatives were 85 % or less. The major cellular lipids of strains WS4917T and WS4993T were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol; the major quinone was Q-9 in both strains, with small amounts of Q-8 in strain WS4917T. The DNA G+C contents of strains WS4917T and WS4993T were 58.08 and 57.30 mol%, respectively. Based on these data, strains WS4917T, WS4995 ( = DSM 29141 = LMG 28434), WS4999, WS5001 and WS5002 should be considered as representatives of a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas helleri sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Pseudomonas helleri is strain WS4917T ( = DSM 29165T = LMG 28433T). Strains WS4993T and WS4994 ( = DSM 29140 = LMG 28438) should be recognized as representing a second novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas weihenstephanensis sp. nov. is proposed.

126	26604259	2015	Nov	24		Electronic	Journal Article	mBio	MBio	2150-7511	Phylogenetic Distribution of CRISPR-Cas Systems in Antibiotic-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an antibiotic-refractory pathogen with a large genome and extensive genotypic diversity. Historically, P. aeruginosa has been a major model system for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying type I clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR-Cas)-based bacterial immune system function. However, little information on the phylogenetic distribution and potential role of these CRISPR-Cas systems in molding the P. aeruginosa accessory genome and antibiotic resistance elements is known. Computational approaches were used to identify and characterize CRISPR-Cas systems within 672 genomes, and in the process, we identified a previously unreported and putatively mobile type I-C P. aeruginosa CRISPR-Cas system. Furthermore, genomes harboring noninhibited type I-F and I-E CRISPR-Cas systems were on average ~300 kb smaller than those without a CRISPR-Cas system. In silico analysis demonstrated that the accessory genome (n = 22,036 genes) harbored the majority of identified CRISPR-Cas targets. We also assembled a global spacer library that aided the identification of difficult-to-characterize mobile genetic elements within next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and allowed CRISPR typing of a majority of P. aeruginosa strains. In summary, our analysis demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas systems play an important role in shaping the accessory genomes of globally distributed P. aeruginosa isolates.;P. aeruginosa is both an antibiotic-refractory pathogen and an important model system for type I CRISPR-Cas bacterial immune systems. By combining the genome sequences of 672 newly and previously sequenced genomes, we were able to provide a global view of the phylogenetic distribution, conservation, and potential targets of these systems. This analysis identified a new and putatively mobile P. aeruginosa CRISPR-Cas subtype, characterized the diverse distribution of known CRISPR-inhibiting genes, and provided a potential new use for CRISPR spacer libraries in accessory genome analysis. Our data demonstrated the importance of CRISPR-Cas systems in modulating the accessory genomes of globally distributed strains while also providing substantial data for subsequent genomic and experimental studies in multiple fields. Understanding why certain genotypes of P. aeruginosa are clinically prevalent and adept at horizontally acquiring virulence and antibiotic resistance elements is of major clinical and economic importance.	6	6	e01796-15	10.1128/mBio.01796-15	van Belkum;Soriaga;LaFave;Akella;Veyrieras;Barbu;Shortridge;Blanc;Hannum;Zambardi;Miller;Enright;Mugnier;Brami;Schicklin;Felderman;Schwartz;Richardson;Peterson;Hubby;Cady	Alex;Leah B;Matthew C;Srividya;Jean-Baptiste;E Magda;Dee;Bernadette;Gregory;Gilles;Kristofer;Mark C;Nathalie;Daniel;Stéphane;Martina;Ariel S;Toby H;Todd C;Bolyn;Kyle C	bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA.;bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA.;bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France.;bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA.;bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA.;Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, United Kingdom.;bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA.;bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA.;Synthetic Genomics, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA kcady@syntheticgenomics.com.	eng	Nat Biotechnol. 2014 Nov;32(11):1146-50;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2009 Jul;64(1):46-51;Microbiology. 2011 Feb;157(Pt 2):430-7;Science. 2010 Sep 10;329(5997):1355-8;PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60575;Genome Announc. 2014 May 22;2(3):null;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2015 May;70(5):1322-30;Science. 2008 Dec 19;322(5909):1843-5;Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2014;4:37;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 8;104(19):8101-6;Nat Biotechnol. 2014 Nov;32(11):1141-5;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009 Oct;22(4):582-610;MBio. 2014;5(1):e00928-13;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2011 Sep;35(5):736-55;Nature. 2011 Sep 22;477(7365):486-9;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104;J Clin Microbiol. 2000 Jul;38(7):2520-4;Biotechnol J. 2007 Jul;2(7):901-6;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;MBio. 2010;1(4). pii: e00227-10. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00227-10;J Clin Microbiol. 2015 Aug;53(8):2622-31;Mol Microbiol. 1993 Dec;10(5):1057-65;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2010 Dec;74(4):621-41;Nature. 2013 Jan 17;493(7432):429-32;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2009 Dec;73(4):750-74;BMC Genomics. 2011;12:438;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Jan;54(1):346-52;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Dec;42(12):5644-9;J Bacteriol. 2012 Nov;194(21):5728-38;FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 2005 Jun 1;44(3):303-9;Microbiology. 2012 Dec;158(Pt 12):2997-3004;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;Rev Infect Dis. 1983 Mar-Apr;5(2):279-313;MBio. 2014;5(2):e00896;J Biol Chem. 2011 Sep 9;286(36):31896-903;Nucleic Acids Res. 2015 Feb 27;43(4):2216-22;J Mol Biol. 2005 Dec 2;354(3):536-45;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Jun 9;112(23):7267-72;Plasmid. 2007 Jul;58(1):76-83;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):518-34;Science. 2007 Mar 23;315(5819):1709-12;J Bacteriol. 1994 Oct;176(20):6286-94;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2014 Oct;20(10):O609-18;Virus Res. 2014 Aug 30;189:43-6;PLoS One. 2009;4(11):e7740;Trends Genet. 2010 Aug;26(8):335-40;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jun 21;108(25):10092-7;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;Nat Biotechnol. 2014 Apr;32(4):347-55;Genome Announc. 2014 Oct 30;2(5):null;Science. 2008 Aug 15;321(5891):960-4;PLoS Genet. 2013 Apr;9(4):e1003454;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2011 Jun;9(6):467-77;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 24;101(8):2530-5;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2012 Mar;18(3):268-81;Microbiology. 2005 Mar;151(Pt 3):653-63;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2015 Jan;59(1):427-36;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 1998 Jun;62(2):275-93;Front Microbiol. 2011 Jul 13;2:150;PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36995;Nature. 2015 Oct 1;526(7571):136-9;PLoS One. 2011;6(2):e16963;PLoS One. 2010;5(1):e8842;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2007 Jul;31(4):449-77;Infect Immun. 2002 Aug;70(8):3985-93;J Clin Microbiol. 2000 Mar;38(3):1008-15;J Bacteriol. 2010 Jul;192(13):3249-58;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Aug;57(8):3775-82;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2005 Aug;11(8):670-3;Mol Cell. 2012 Jun 8;46(5):595-605;EMBO J. 2011 Apr 6;30(7):1335-42;J Clin Microbiol. 2003 Jan;41(1):15-26	MEDLINE	epublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an environmentally ubiquitous Gram-negative bacterium and important opportunistic human pathogen, causing severe chronic respiratory infections in patients with underlying conditions such as cystic fibrosis (CF) or bronchiectasis. In order to identify mechanisms responsible for adaptation during bronchiectasis infections, a bronchiectasis isolate, PAHM4, was phenotypically and genotypically characterized.;This strain displays phenotypes that have been associated with chronic respiratory infections in CF including alginate over-production, rough lipopolysaccharide, quorum-sensing deficiency, loss of motility, decreased protease secretion, and hypermutation. Hypermutation is a key adaptation of this bacterium during the course of chronic respiratory infections and analysis indicates that PAHM4 encodes a mutated mutS gene responsible for a ~1,000-fold increase in mutation rate compared to wild-type laboratory strain P. aeruginosa PAO1. Antibiotic resistance profiles and sequence data indicate that this strain acquired numerous mutations associated with increased resistance levels to β-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones when compared to PAO1. Sequencing of PAHM4 revealed a 6.38 Mbp genome, 5.9 % of which were unrecognized in previously reported P. aeruginosa genome sequences. Transcriptome analysis suggests a general down-regulation of virulence factors, while metabolism of amino acids and lipids is up-regulated when compared to PAO1 and metabolic modeling identified further potential differences between PAO1 and PAHM4.;This work provides insights into the potential differential adaptation of this bacterium to the lung of patients with bronchiectasis compared to other clinical settings such as cystic fibrosis, findings that should aid the development of disease-appropriate treatment strategies for P. aeruginosa infections.	16		883	10.1186/s12864-015-2069-0	Varga;Barbier;Mulet;Bielecki;Bartell;Owings;Martinez-Ramos;Hittle;Davis;Damron;Liechti;Puchałka;dos Santos;Ernst;Papin;Albertí;Oliver;Goldberg	John J;Mariette;Xavier;Piotr;Jennifer A;Joshua P;Inmaculada;Lauren E;Michael R;F Heath;George W;Jacek;Vitor A P Martins;Robert K;Jason A;Sebastian;Antonio;Joanna B	Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pulmonology, Allergy/Immunology, Cystic Fibrosis and Sleep, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA. jvarga@emory.edu.;Emory + Children's Center for Cystic Fibrosis Research, Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA. jvarga@emory.edu.;Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA. jvarga@emory.edu.;Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA. mariette.barbier@gmail.com.;Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, WV, USA. mariette.barbier@gmail.com.;Servicio de Microbiología and Unidad de Investigación, Hospital Son Espases, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa), Palma, de Mallorca, Spain. xavier.mulet@ssib.es.;Synthetic and Systems Biology Research Group, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany. piotr.bielecki@yale.edu.;Present address: Immunobiology Department, Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA. piotr.bielecki@yale.edu.;Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA. jagbartell@gmail.com.;Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pulmonology, Allergy/Immunology, Cystic Fibrosis and Sleep, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA. jpowings@gmail.com.;Emory + Children's Center for Cystic Fibrosis Research, Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA. jpowings@gmail.com.;Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA. jpowings@gmail.com.;IUNICS, University of the Balearic Islands, Palma, de Mallorca, Spain. elbesodeldragon@hotmail.com.;Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, University of Maryland School of Dentistry, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA. lhitt001@gmail.com.;Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA. michaelrdavisjr@gmail.com.;Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA. heathdamron@gmail.com.;Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, WV, USA. heathdamron@gmail.com.;Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA. george.liechti.ctr@usuhs.edu.;Servicio de Microbiología and Unidad de Investigación, Hospital Son Espases, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa), Palma, de Mallorca, Spain.

129	26483767	2015				Electronic-eCollection	Journal Article	Frontiers in microbiology	Front Microbiol	1664-302X	Clinical utilization of genomics data produced by the international Pseudomonas aeruginosa consortium.	The International Pseudomonas aeruginosa Consortium is sequencing over 1000 genomes and building an analysis pipeline for the study of Pseudomonas genome evolution, antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Metadata, including genomic and phenotypic data for each isolate of the collection, are available through the International Pseudomonas Consortium Database (http://ipcd.ibis.ulaval.ca/). Here, we present our strategy and the results that emerged from the analysis of the first 389 genomes. With as yet unmatched resolution, our results confirm that P. aeruginosa strains can be divided into three major groups that are further divided into subgroups, some not previously reported in the literature. We also provide the first snapshot of P. aeruginosa strain diversity with respect to antibiotic resistance. Our approach will allow us to draw potential links between environmental strains and those implicated in human and animal infections, understand how patients become infected and how the infection evolves over time as well as identify prognostic markers for better evidence-based decisions on patient care.	6		1036	10.3389/fmicb.2015.01036	Freschi;Jeukens;Kukavica-Ibrulj;Boyle;Dupont;Laroche;Larose;Maaroufi;Fothergill;Moore;Winsor;Aaron;Barbeau;Bell;Burns;Camara;Cantin;Charette;Dewar;Déziel;Grimwood;Hancock;Harrison;Heeb;Jelsbak;Jia;Kenna;Kidd;Klockgether;Lam;Lamont;Lewenza;Loman;Malouin;Manos;McArthur;McKeown;Milot;Naghra;Nguyen;Pereira;Perron;Pirnay;Rainey;Rousseau;Santos;Stephenson;Taylor;Turton;Waglechner;Williams;Thrane;Wright;Brinkman;Tucker;Tümmler;Winstanley;Levesque	Luca;Julie;Irena;Brian;Marie-Josée;Jérôme;Stéphane;Halim;Joanne L;Matthew;Geoffrey L;Shawn D;Jean;Scott C;Jane L;Miguel;André;Steve J;Ken;Éric;Keith;Robert E W;Joe J;Stephan;Lars;Baofeng;Dervla T;Timothy J;Jens;Joseph S;Iain L;Shawn;Nick;François;Jim;Andrew G;Josie;Julie;Hardeep;Dao;Sheldon K;Gabriel G;Jean-Paul;Paul B;Simon;Pedro M;Anne;Véronique;Jane F;Nicholas;Paul;Sandra W;Gerard D;Fiona S L;Nicholas P;Burkhard;Craig;Roger C	Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology, Université Laval Quebec, QC, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology, Université Laval Quebec, QC, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology, Université Laval Quebec, QC, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology, Université Laval Quebec, QC, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology, Université Laval Quebec, QC, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology, Université Laval Quebec, QC, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology, Université Laval Quebec, QC, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology, Université Laval Quebec, QC, Canada.;Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool Liverpool, UK.;Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool Liverpool, UK.;Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Ottawa Hospital Research Institute Ottawa, ON, Canada.;Faculté de Médecine Dentaire, Université de Montréal Montréal, QC, Canada.;QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute Brisbane, QLD, Australia.;Seattle Children's Research Institute, University of Washington School of Medicine Seattle, WA, USA.;School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham Nottingham, UK.;Département de Médecine, Université de Sherbrooke Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology, Université Laval Quebec, QC, Canada ; Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec Quebec, QC, Canada ; Département de Biochimie, de Microbiologie et de Bio-informatique, Faculté des Sciences et de Génie, Université Laval Quebec, QC, Canada.;Department of Human Genetics, McGill University Montreal, QC, Canada.;INRS Institut Armand Frappier Laval, QC, Canada.;School of Medicine, Griffith University Gold Coast, QLD, Australia.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of British Columbia Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Biological Sciences, University of Calgary Calgary, AB, Canada.;School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham Nottingham, UK.;Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark Lyngby, Denmark.;M.G.

131	26431321	2015				Electronic-eCollection	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	PloS one	PLoS ONE	1932-6203	Genetically and Phenotypically Distinct Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cystic Fibrosis Isolates Share a Core Proteomic Signature.	The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is among the main colonizers of the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We have isolated and sequenced several P. aeruginosa isolates from the sputum of CF patients and compared them with each other and with the model strain PAO1. Phenotypic analysis of CF isolates showed significant variability in colonization and virulence-related traits suggesting different strategies for adaptation to the CF lung. Genomic analysis indicated these strains shared a large set of core genes with the standard laboratory strain PAO1, and identified the genetic basis for some of the observed phenotypic differences. Proteomics revealed that in a conventional laboratory medium PAO1 expressed 827 proteins that were absent in the CF isolates while the CF isolates shared a distinctive signature set of 703 proteins not detected in PAO1. PAO1 expressed many transporters for the uptake of organic nutrients and relatively few biosynthetic pathways. Conversely, the CF isolates expressed a narrower range of transporters and a broader set of metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides and polyamines. The proteomic data suggests that in a common laboratory medium PAO1 may transport a diverse set of ready-made nutrients from the rich medium, whereas the CF isolates may only utilize a limited number of nutrients from the medium relying mainly on their own metabolism for synthesis of essential nutrients. These variations indicate significant differences between the metabolism and physiology of P. aeruginosa CF isolates and PAO1 that cannot be detected at the genome level alone. The widening gap between the increasing genomic data and the lack of phenotypic data means that researchers are increasingly reliant on extrapolating from genomic comparisons using experimentally characterized model organisms such as PAO1. While comparative genomics can provide valuable information, our data suggests that such extrapolations may be fraught with peril.	10	10	e0138527	10.1371/journal.pone.0138527	Penesyan;Kumar;Kamath;Shathili;Venkatakrishnan;Krisp;Packer;Molloy;Paulsen	Anahit;Sheemal S;Karthik;Abdulrahman M;Vignesh;Christoph;Nicolle H;Mark P;Ian T	Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; Australian Proteome Analysis Facility, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; Australian Proteome Analysis Facility, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.;Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.	eng	J Clin Invest. 1992 Feb;89(2):657-65;J Pediatr. 2001 May;138(5):699-704;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;BMC Bioinformatics. 2011;12:124;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2011 Jun 15;183(12):1674-9;Infect Immun. 1998 Mar;66(3):1000-7;Nat Protoc. 2006;1(6):2856-60;Microbiologyopen. 2013 Dec;2(6):1010-23;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jul 31;98(16):9342-7;J Gen Microbiol. 1955 Dec;13(3):572-81;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2010 Sep;76(17):5710-7;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;Int J Mol Sci. 2014;15(2):2840-57;J Bacteriol. 2001 Nov;183(21):6454-65;Microbiology. 2004 May;150(Pt 5):1315-26;PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60225;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):821-9;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Infect Immun. 1988 Sep;56(9):2515-7;PLoS One. 2014;9(2):e87611;Infect Immun. 1985 Sep;49(3):770-4;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2010 May;86(6):1659-70;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Feb 17;112(7):2187-91;Infect Immun. 2004 Jul;72(7):4275-8;Am J Pathol. 2009 Dec;175(6):2473-88;Arch Microbiol. 2000 Sep;174(3):135-42;Mol Cell Proteomics. 2012 Jun;11(6):O111.016717;J Infect Dis. 2001 Feb 1;183(3):444-52;J Bacteriol. 2014 Jun;196(12):2265-76;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jun 24;100(13):7907-12;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;Infect Immun. 2013 Aug;81(8):2697-704;BMC Microbiol. 2012;12:16;PLoS One. 2009;4(8):e6655;Pediatr Pulmonol. 2002 Aug;34(2):91-100;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1998 Sep 15;166(2):341-5;J Biomed Biotechnol. 2011;2011:852513;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jan;42(Database issue):D459-71;J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(8):2700-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004;32(4):1363-71;BMC Genomics. 2011;12:402;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2012 Feb;15(1):71-7;Nat Biotechnol. 2014 Mar;32(3):223-6;J Biol Chem. 2015 Apr 3;290(14):8789-802;Curr Opin Pediatr. 2007 Feb;19(1):83-8;Microbiol Immunol. 2011 Apr;55(4):224-30;Nature. 2004 Aug 26;430(7003):1024-7;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2006 Aug;4(8):597-607;Glycobiology. 2007 Jul;17(7):698-712;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Apr;64(2):512-33;Bioinformatics. 2013 Apr 15;29(8):1072-5;Nucleic Acids Res. 2006;34(13):3771-8;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2012;66:493-520;BMC Microbiol. 2011;11:218;Pediatr Pulmonol. 2007 Jun;42(6):525-32;Methods Enzymol. 1999;310:20-42;PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24526;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2011 Sep;17(9):1415-20;Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):1913-28;Acta Microbiol Acad Sci Hung. 1970;17(1):35-48;Genome Res. 2004 Jul;14(7):1394-403;Expert Rev Respir Med. 2013 Oct;7(5):553-76;J Gen Microbiol. 1988 Jan;134(1):43-52;Arch Microbiol. 2001 May;175(5):384-8;J Bacteriol. 2003 Nov;185(22):6658-65;PLoS Pathog. 2013 Jan;9(1):e1003101	MEDLINE	epublish

133	26396243	2015	Sep	22		Electronic	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	mBio	MBio	2150-7511	The Widespread Multidrug-Resistant Serotype O12 Pseudomonas aeruginosa Clone Emerged through Concomitant Horizontal Transfer of Serotype Antigen and Antibiotic Resistance Gene Clusters.	The O-specific antigen (OSA) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide is highly varied by sugar identity, side chains, and bond between O-repeats. These differences classified P. aeruginosa into 20 distinct serotypes. In the past few decades, O12 has emerged as the predominant serotype in clinical settings and outbreaks. These serotype O12 isolates exhibit high levels of resistance to various classes of antibiotics. Here, we explore how the P. aeruginosa OSA biosynthesis gene clusters evolve in the population by investigating the association between the phylogenetic relationships among 83 P. aeruginosa strains and their serotypes. While most serotypes were closely linked to the core genome phylogeny, we observed horizontal exchange of OSA biosynthesis genes among phylogenetically distinct P. aeruginosa strains. Specifically, we identified a serotype island ranging from 62 kb to 185 kb containing the P. aeruginosa O12 OSA gene cluster, an antibiotic resistance determinant (gyrA(C248T)), and other genes that have been transferred between P. aeruginosa strains with distinct core genome architectures. We showed that these genes were likely acquired from an O12 serotype strain that is closely related to P. aeruginosa PA7. Acquisition and recombination of the serotype island resulted in displacement of the native OSA gene cluster and expression of the O12 serotype in the recipients. Serotype switching by recombination has apparently occurred multiple times involving bacteria of various genomic backgrounds. In conclusion, serotype switching in combination with acquisition of an antibiotic resistance determinant most likely contributed to the dissemination of the O12 serotype in clinical settings.;Infection rates in hospital settings by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa clones have increased during the past decades, and serotype O12 is predominant among these epidemic strains. It is not known why the MDR phenotype is associated with serotype O12 and how this clone type has emerged. This study shows that evolution of MDR O12 strains involved a switch from an ancestral O4 serotype to O12. Serotype switching was the result of horizontal transfer and genetic recombination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis genes originating from an MDR taxonomic outlier P. aeruginosa strain. Moreover, the recombination event also resulted in acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes. These results impact on our understanding of MDR outbreak strain and serotype evolution and can potentially assist in better monitoring and prevention.	6	5	e01396-15	10.1128/mBio.01396-15	Thrane;Taylor;Freschi;Kukavica-Ibrulj;Boyle;Laroche;Pirnay;Lévesque;Lam;Jelsbak	Sandra Wingaard;Véronique L;Luca;Irena;Brian;Jérôme;Jean-Paul;Roger C;Joseph S;Lars	Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.;Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology (IBIS), Université Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology (IBIS), Université Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology (IBIS), Université Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology (IBIS), Université Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.;Laboratory for Molecular and Cellular Technology, Queen Astrid Military Hospital, Brussels, Belgium.;Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology (IBIS), Université Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.;Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada jlam@uoguelph.ca lj@bio.dtu.dk.;Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark jlam@uoguelph.ca lj@bio.dtu.dk.	eng	J Clin Microbiol. 1990 May;28(5):922-5;Infect Immun. 1987 May;55(5):1051-7;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;CSH Protoc. 2006 Jun 01;2006(1):null;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:75;PLoS Pathog. 2014 Feb;10(2):e1003898;J Hosp Infect. 1997 Jun;36(2):105-16;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Dec 24;110(52):21065-70;J Clin Microbiol. 1994 Mar;32(3):666-71;Mol Microbiol. 1996 Nov;22(3):481-95;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Mar;39(5):1237-47;Epidemiol Infect. 1989 Dec;103(3):565-76;J Antimicrob Chemother. 1990 Sep;26(3):319-28;Environ Microbiol. 2009 May;11(5):1303-13;Innate Immun. 2009 Oct;15(5):261-312;Mol Microbiol. 2000 Oct;38(2):213-31;J Clin Microbiol. 1989 May;27(5):962-7;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 1997 Nov;21(3):243-77;Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 1988 Apr;7(2):265-9;Mol Microbiol. 1998 Sep;29(6):1419-34;J Bacteriol. 1997 Aug;179(15):4713-24;J Bacteriol. 1984 Jun;158(3):1115-21;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2012 Sep;18(9):E369-72;Environ Microbiol. 2015 Jan;17(1):29-46;PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e44199;J Bacteriol. 2002 Jul;184(13):3614-22;Microbiology. 1999 Dec;145 ( Pt 12):3505-21;Nat Genet. 2015 Jan;47(1):57-64;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2014 Oct;20(10):O609-18;PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25617;PLoS One. 2009;4(11):e7740;J Bacteriol. 2000 Jun;182(11):3125-35;J Bacteriol. 2010 Apr;192(7):1921-8;Front Microbiol. 2014 Nov 26;5:643;J Bacteriol. 1999 Jul;181(14):4275-84;Clin Diagn Lab Immunol. 1995 Sep;2(5):554-62;Mol Microbiol. 2000 Feb;35(4):718-27;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2015 Jan;59(1):427-36;Pathog Dis. 2014 Jun;71(1):20-5;PLoS One. 2010;5(1):e8842;Genome Biol. 2014;15(11):524;Science. 2011 Jan 28;331(6016):430-4;J Clin Microbiol. 2011 Jul;49(7):2578-83;Front Microbiol. 2011 Jun 01;2:118;Genome Biol Evol. 2015 Jan;7(1):18-34;PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e42304;J Bacteriol. 1983 Apr;154(1):269-77	MEDLINE	epublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that forms highly stable communities - biofilms, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of infections. The biofilm state and intrinsic/acquired bacterial resistance mechanisms contribute to resistance/tolerance to antibiotics that is frequently observed in P. aeruginosa isolates. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of six novel lytic bacteriophages: viruses that infect bacteria, which together efficiently infect and kill a wide range of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. The phages were used to formulate a cocktail with the potential to eliminate P. aeruginosa PAO1 planktonic cultures. Two biofilm models were studied, one static and one dynamic, and the phage cocktail was assessed for its ability to reduce and disperse the biofilm biomass. For the static model, after 4 h of contact with the phage suspension (MOI 10) more than 95% of biofilm biomass was eliminated. In the flow biofilm model, a slower rate of activity by the phage was observed, but 48 h after addition of the phage cocktail the biofilm was dispersed, with most cells eliminated (> 4 logs) comparing with the control. This cocktail has the potential for development as a therapeutic to control P. aeruginosa infections, which are predominantly biofilm centred.	9	1	61-74	10.1111/1751-7915.12316	Alves;Perez-Esteban;Kot;Bean;Arnot;Hansen;Enright;Jenkins	Diana R;P;W;J E;T;L H;Mark C;A Tobias A	Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath, Claverton Down, BA2 7AY, UK.;Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Bath, Bath, Claverton Down, BA2 7AY, UK.;Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus Universitet, Frederiksborgvej 399, Postboks, 358, Roskilde, DK-4000, Denmark.;Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath, Claverton Down, BA2 7AY, UK.;Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Bath, Bath, Claverton Down, BA2 7AY, UK.;Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus Universitet, Frederiksborgvej 399, Postboks, 358, Roskilde, DK-4000, Denmark.;School of Healthcare Sciences, Manchester Metropolitan University, John Dalton Building, Chester Street, Manchester, M1 5GD, UK.;Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath, Claverton Down, BA2 7AY, UK.	eng	Nat Rev Microbiol. 2010 May;8(5):317-27;Virol J. 2014;11:14;Virology. 2008 Aug 1;377(2):233-8;PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e47742;J Med Microbiol. 2009 Sep;58(Pt 9):1133-48;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009 Oct;22(4):582-610;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:75;Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2010 Jan;11(1):69-86;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Jan;54(1):397-404;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;PLoS One. 2012;7(3):e31698;J Microbiol Methods. 2012 Aug;90(2):115-8;J Microbiol Methods. 2009 May;77(2):207-13;Science. 1997 Mar 14;275(5306):1655-7;Epidemiol Perspect Innov. 2011 Feb 02;8(1):1;Res Microbiol. 2008 Jun;159(5):400-5;Genome Announc. 2014 Feb 06;2(1):null;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2012 Nov;67(11):2640-4;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2011 Apr;9(4):265-78;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1967 Feb;57(2):292-5;Res Microbiol. 1998 Jul-Aug;149(7):487-95;J Clin Microbiol. 2014 May;52(5):1501-10;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2000;54:799-825;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1981 Mar;41(3):628-34;Virology. 2003 Jul 20;312(1):49-59;Biotechnol Prog. 2014 Jul-Aug;30(4):932-44;Res Microbiol. 2011 Oct;162(8):737-46;Genetics. 1998 Apr;148(4):1539-50;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 1995 Aug;17(1-2):191-205;Surgery. 1989 Jul;106(1):37-44;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2874-83;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2011 May;90(4):1333-45;J Infect Chemother. 2005 Oct;11(5):211-9;Wound Repair Regen. 2008 Jan-Feb;16(1):37-44;Virology. 2010 Sep 15;405(1):26-30;J Virol Methods. 2014 Feb;196:152-6;Res Microbiol. 2011 Oct;162(8):798-806;J Virol. 1977 Sep;23(3):461-6;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2015 Jan;59(1):427-36;Infect Immun. 1991 Feb;59(2):471-7;J Gen Microbiol. 1961 Oct;26:313-23;Microbes Infect. 2003 Nov;5(13):1213-9;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jun;12(6):1734-47;Genome Announc. 2013 Dec 12;1(6):null;J Clin Microbiol. 1981 May;13(5):982-8;Science. 2000 May 19;288(5469):1251-4;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2004 Apr;64(2):270-4;PLoS Biol. 2008 May 20;6(5):e120;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2014 Nov;80(21):6694-703;Prog Drug Res. 1991;37:91-105;J Appl Microbiol. 1998 Sep;85(3):583-90;J Virol. 1969 Mar;3(3):290-6;Annu Rev Biochem. 1995;64:171-200	MEDLINE	ppublish
135	26335566	2015	Sep	03		Electronic	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	BMC genomics	BMC Genomics	1471-2164	The isolation and characterization of two Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteriophages capable of cross-taxonomic order infectivity.	A rapid worldwide increase in the number of human infections caused by the extremely antibiotic resistant bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is prompting alarm. One potential treatment solution to the current antibiotic resistance dilemma is phage therapy, the clinical application of bacteriophages to selectively kill bacteria.;Towards that end, phages DLP1 and DLP2 (vB_SmaS-DLP_1 and vB_SmaS-DLP_2, respectively) were isolated against S. maltophilia strain D1585. Host range analysis for each phage was conducted using 27 clinical S. maltophilia isolates and 11 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Both phages exhibit unusually broad host ranges capable of infecting bacteria across taxonomic orders. Transmission electron microscopy of the phage DLP1 and DLP2 morphology reveals that they belong to the Siphoviridae family of bacteriophages. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and complete genome sequencing and analysis indicates that phages DLP1 and DLP2 are closely related but different phages, sharing 96.7 % identity over 97.2 % of their genomes. These two phages are also related to P. aeruginosa phages vB_Pae-Kakheti_25 (PA25), PA73, and vB_PaeS_SCH_Ab26 (Ab26) and more distantly related to Burkholderia cepacia complex phage KL1, which together make up a taxonomic sub-family. Phages DLP1 and DLP2 exhibited significant differences in host ranges and growth kinetics.;The isolation and characterization of phages able to infect two completely different species of bacteria is an exciting discovery, as phages typically can only infect related bacterial species, and rarely infect bacteria across taxonomic families, let alone across taxonomic orders.	16		664	10.1186/s12864-015-1848-y	Peters;Lynch;Stothard;Dennis	Danielle L;Karlene H;Paul;Jonathan J	Department of Biological Sciences, 6-065 Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2E9, Canada. dlpeters@ualberta.ca.;Department of Biological Sciences, 6-065 Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2E9, Canada. khlynch@ualberta.ca.;Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, 1400 College Plaza, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2C8, Canada. stothard@ualberta.ca.;Department of Biological Sciences, 6-065 Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2E9, Canada. jon.dennis@ualberta.ca.	eng	Appl Environ Microbiol. 1999 Jan;65(1):156-62;Poult Sci. 2007 Dec;86(12):2536-40;PLoS One. 2010;5(11):e13904;J Mol Biol. 2001 Jan 19;305(3):567-80;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2011 Mar;77(6):2042-50;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 Dec;74(24):7552-60;J Appl Microbiol. 2011 Jan;110(1):106-17;Adv Virus Res. 2012;83:3-40;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jun 1;30(11):2478-83;Thorax. 2009 Nov;64(11):926-31;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2012 Jan;25(1):2-41;BMC Genomics. 2010;11:599;Arch Virol. 2012 Sep;157(9):1643-50;Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2010 Jan;11(1):69-86;Genome Res. 2009 Sep;19(9):1639-45;Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jul;41(12):6175-89;C R Biol. 2005 Dec;328(12):1065-72;Environ Microbiol. 2006 Dec;8(12):2074-82;J Virol. 2012 Dec;86(24):13839-40;PLoS One. 2009;4(3):e4944;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 Apr;74(7):2135-43;Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2011 Sep;9(9):775-85;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2012 Jan;78(1):58-69;Bioinformatics. 2007 Mar 15;23(6):673-9;Trends Microbiol. 2005 May;13(5):236-42;Bacteriophage. 2011 Mar;1(2):66-85;Trends Microbiol. 2013 Feb;21(2):82-91;RNA Biol. 2013 Jan;10(1):96-110;Trends Microbiol. 2015 Apr;23(4):185-91;J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv. 2013 Dec;26(6):317-35;BMC Microbiol. 2014;14:17;Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2011;1:27;J Med Microbiol. 2011 Feb;60(Pt 2):205-10;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Jan;59(2):590-601;PLoS One. 2014;9(1):e87339;Protein Sci. 2010 Oct;19(10):1967-77;J Virol. 2010 Feb;84(3):1276-88;Plasmid. 2010 Jan;63(1):61-7;J Wound Care. 2009 Jun;18(6):237-8, 240-3;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 May;53(5):2205-8;Arch Virol. 2014 Jun;159(6):1293-303;J Mol Biol. 2007 Nov 9;373(5):1098-112;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2012 Jun;94(6):1609-17;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(3):1184-7;Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Jun 15;29(12):2607-18;Protein Sci. 2003 Aug;12(8):1652-62;BMC Genomics. 2013;14:574;PLoS One. 2008;3(4):e2048;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D225-9;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2014 Oct;80(20):6446-57;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2004 Oct;48(10):3817-22;FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 2012 Jul;65(2):395-8;Arch Microbiol. 2007 Aug;188(2):191-7;J Appl Microbiol. 2003;95(1):180-5;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2005 Oct 15;251(2):273-80;PLoS One. 2011;6(2):e16963;Mol Microbiol. 2008 Oct;70(2):341-51;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014 Jul;58(7):4005-13;J Cyst Fibros. 2013 Sep;12(5):482-6;Clin Otolaryngol. 2009 Aug;34(4):349-57;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Mar;71(3):1387-93;Arch Microbiol. 2006 Jun;185(6):449-58;Nature. 2003 Aug 28;424(6952):1047-51;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W244-8;J Virol. 2012 Oct;86(20):11392-3;BMC Genomics. 2012;13:223;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402	MEDLINE	epublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium and a clinically significant opportunistic human pathogen. Central to the ability of P. aeruginosa to colonise both environmental and host niches is the acquisition of zinc. Here we show that P. aeruginosa PAO1 acquires zinc via an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) permease in which ZnuA is the high affinity, zinc-specific binding protein. Zinc uptake in Gram-negative organisms predominantly occurs via an ABC permease, and consistent with this expectation a P. aeruginosa ΔznuA mutant strain showed an ~60% reduction in cellular zinc accumulation, while other metal ions were essentially unaffected. Despite the major reduction in zinc accumulation, minimal phenotypic differences were observed between the wild-type and ΔznuA mutant strains. However, the effect of zinc limitation on the transcriptome of P. aeruginosa PAO1 revealed significant changes in gene expression that enable adaptation to low-zinc conditions. Genes significantly up-regulated included non-zinc-requiring paralogs of zinc-dependent proteins and a number of novel import pathways associated with zinc acquisition. Collectively, this study provides new insight into the acquisition of zinc by P. aeruginosa PAO1, revealing a hitherto unrecognized complexity in zinc homeostasis that enables the bacterium to survive under zinc limitation.	5		13139	10.1038/srep13139	Pederick;Eijkelkamp;Begg;Ween;McAllister;Paton;McDevitt	Victoria G;Bart A;Stephanie L;Miranda P;Lauren J;James C;Christopher A	Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.;Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.;Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.;Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.;Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.;Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.;Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.	eng	Mol Microbiol. 2014 Feb;91(4):834-51;Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2013;3:108;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2014 Nov;80(21):6843-52;Nat Commun. 2015;6:6418;J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem. 2015 Apr;30(2):325-32;Ecotoxicol Environ Saf. 2000 Mar;45(3):198-207;J Biol Chem. 2000 Aug 11;275(32):24321-32;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Science. 2001 Jun 29;292(5526):2488-92;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Jul;41(1):167-78;Genome Biol. 2001;2(9):RESEARCH 0033;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Jul;45(1):145-53;Infect Immun. 2002 Aug;70(8):4721-5;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jul 1;31(13):3381-5;FEBS Lett. 2010 Jun 18;584(12):2606-17;J Bacteriol. 2003 Aug;185(15):4354-61;J Mol Biol. 2003 Nov 7;333(5):1061-9;Genome Res. 2004 Jun;14(6):1188-90;Arch Microbiol. 2004 Sep;182(1):7-17;J Mol Biol. 1994 Feb 4;235(5):1501-31;Gene. 1996 Nov 7;179(1):9-19;PLoS Pathog. 2010;6:e1000969;Infect Immun. 2010 Dec;78(12):5163-77;Mol Microbiol. 2011 Feb;79(3):700-15;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;BMC Microbiol. 2011;11:36;J Biol Chem. 1997 Nov 14;272(46):29033-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Dec 23;94(26):14326-31;Electrophoresis. 1997 Dec;18(15):2714-23;Mol Microbiol. 1998 Jun;28(6):1199-210;Mol Microbiol. 1999 Jul;33(1):200-7;Infect Immun. 1999 Oct;67(10):5060-8;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2005 Apr;8(2):196-202;Mol Microbiol. 2005 May;56(4):1087-102;BMC Microbiol. 2005;5:30;Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 Jul 1;34(Web Server issue):W604-8;J Proteome Res. 2006 Nov;5(11):3173-8;J Mol Biol. 2007 May 18;368(5):1358-66;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Jul;65(1):137-52;Biochemistry. 2007 Jul 31;46(30):8734-43;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Aug;65(4):1049-63;J Biol Inorg Chem. 2008 Feb;13(2):271-88;J Biol Inorg Chem. 2008 Nov;13(8):1205-18;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Mar 24;106(12):4677-82;Bioinformatics. 2009 Aug 15;25(16):2078-9;J Bacteriol. 2009 Oct;191(19):6116-22;J Bacteriol. 2009 Nov;191(22):6936-49;BMC Genomics. 2009;10:470;Bioinformatics. 2010 Mar 15;26(6):841-2;BMC Genomics. 2011;12:126;PLoS Pathog. 2011 Nov;7(11):e1002357;Nat Methods. 2012 Apr;9(4):357-9;Bioinformatics. 2012 Apr 15;28(8):1166-7;J Inorg Biochem. 2012 Jun;111:173-81;PLoS One. 2012;7(6):e39139;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2012 Aug;10(8):525-37;Curr Drug Targets. 2012 Oct;13(11):1400-10;Protoplasma. 2012 Oct;249(4):919-42;Environ Microbiol. 2013 Mar;15(3):702-15;Biometals. 2013 Aug;26(4):623-32;PLoS One. 2013;8(9):e75389;Nat Chem Biol. 2014 Jan;10(1):35-41;Mol Microbiol. 2014 Aug;93(4):759-75	MEDLINE	epublish
138	26282874	2015	Sep			Print-Electronic	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	Evolution; international journal of organic evolution	Evolution	1558-5646	Conflict of interest and signal interference lead to the breakdown of honest signaling.	Animals use signals to coordinate a wide range of behaviors, from feeding offspring to predator avoidance. This poses an evolutionary problem, because individuals could potentially signal dishonestly to coerce others into behaving in ways that benefit the signaler. Theory suggests that honest signaling is favored when individuals share a common interest and signals carry reliable information. Here, we exploit the opportunities offered by bacterial signaling to test these predictions with an experimental evolution approach. We show that: (1) reduced relatedness leads to the relative breakdown of signaling, (2) signaling breaks down by the invasion of mutants that show both reduced signaling and reduced response to signal, (3) the genetic route to signaling breakdown is variable, and (4) the addition of artificial signal, to interfere with signal information, also leads to reduced signaling. Our results provide clear support for signaling theory, but we did not find evidence for previously predicted coercion at intermediate relatedness, suggesting that mechanistic details can alter the qualitative nature of specific predictions. Furthermore, populations evolved under low relatedness caused less mortality to insect hosts, showing how signal evolution in bacterial pathogens can drive the evolution of virulence in the opposite direction to that often predicted by theory.	69	9	2371-83	10.1111/evo.12751	Popat;Pollitt;Harrison;Naghra;Hong;Chan;Griffin;Williams;Brown;West;Diggle	Roman;Eric J G;Freya;Hardeep;Kar-Wai;Kok-Gan;Ashleigh S;Paul;Sam P;Stuart A;Stephen P	School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.;Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution, Ashworth Laboratories, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings, West Mains Road, Edinburgh, EH9 3JT, United Kingdom.;School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.;School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.;School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.;Institute of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya, 50603, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Institute of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya, 50603, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PS, United Kingdom.;School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.;Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution, Ashworth Laboratories, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings, West Mains Road, Edinburgh, EH9 3JT, United Kingdom.;Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PS, United Kingdom.;School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, United Kingdom. steve.diggle@nottingham.ac.uk.	eng	PLoS One. 2009 Aug 17;4(8):e6655;Proc Biol Sci. 2012 Sep 7;279(1742):3584-8;J Bacteriol. 1980 Jun;142(3):836-42;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Sep 25;98(20):11394-8;Trends Microbiol. 2002 Sep;10(9):401-5;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Mar 28;97(7):3526-31;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Apr 14;106(15):6339-44;J Theor Biol. 1990 Jun 21;144(4):473-516;J Theor Biol. 1964 Jul;7(1):1-16;Am Nat. 2007 Sep;170(3):331-42;J Bacteriol. 1997 Jun;179(12):3928-35;Evolution. 2004 May;58(5):1038-46;Q Rev Biol. 1996 Mar;71(1):37-78;Evolution. 2014 Feb;68(2):318-31;Science. 2001 Jun 1;292(5522):1710-2;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 May 22;109(21):8259-63;J Biochem. 2006 Sep;140(3):439-44;J Med Chem. 2003 Jan 2;46(1):97-104;Infect Immun. 2014 Mar;82(3):1045-51;Biol Lett. 2008 Jun 23;4(3):237-9;J Theor Biol. 1990 Jun 21;144(4):517-46;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Jan 4;91(1):225-6;Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2009 Nov 12;364(1533):3157-68;J Evol Biol. 2014 Mar;27(3):551-6;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Oct 2;104(40):15876-81;Proc Biol Sci. 2003 Jan 7;270(1510):37-44;Proc Biol Sci. 2001 May 7;268(1470):961-5;Nature. 2004 Aug 26;430(7003):1024-7;Curr Biol. 2009 Feb 24;19(4):341-5;Science. 2010 Mar 12;327(5971):1373-6;Proc Biol Sci. 2012 Dec 7;279(1748):4765-71;Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2007 Jul 29;362(1483):1119-34;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2013;67:43-63;Proc Biol Sci. 2005 May 7;272(1566):941-7;Science. 1993 Mar 5;259(5100):1442-5;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Dec;66(6):1557-65;Nature. 2004 Nov 11;432(7014):218-22;Science. 2001 May 11;292(5519):1099-102;Trends Microbiol. 2012 Dec;20(12):586-94;Nature. 2007 Nov 15;450(7168):411-4	MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the Multi-Drug-Resistant organisms most frequently isolated worldwide and, because of a shortage of new antibiotics, bacteriophages are considered an alternative for its treatment. Previously, P. aeruginosa phages were isolated and best candidates were chosen based on their ability to form clear plaques and their host range. This work aimed to characterize one of those phages, ΦPan70, preliminarily identified as a good candidate for phage-therapy. We performed infection curves, biofilm removal assays, transmission-electron-microscopy, pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis, and studied the in vivo ΦPan70 biological activity in the burned mouse model. ΦPan70 was classified as a member of the Myoviridae family and, in both planktonic cells and biofilms, was responsible for a significant reduction in the bacterial population. The burned mouse model showed an animal survival between 80% and 100%, significantly different from the control animals (0%). However, analysis of the ΦPan70 genome revealed that it was 64% identical to F10, a temperate P. aeruginosa phage. Gene annotation indicated ΦPan70 as a new, but possible temperate phage, therefore not ideal for phage-therapy. Based on this, we recommend genome sequence analysis as an early step to select candidate phages for potential application in phage-therapy, before entering into a more intensive characterization.	7	8	4602-23	10.3390/v7082835	Holguín;Rangel;Clavijo;Prada;Mantilla;Gomez;Kutter;Taylor;Fineran;Barrios;Vives	Angela V;Guillermo;Viviana;Catalina;Marcela;María Catalina;Elizabeth;Corinda;Peter C;Andrés Fernando González;Martha J	Department of Biological Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Carrera 1#18A-12, Bogotá 111711, Colombia. av.holguin103@uniandes.edu.co.;Department of Biological Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Carrera 1#18A-12, Bogotá 111711, Colombia. garp1@leicester.ac.uk.;Department of Biological Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Carrera 1#18A-12, Bogotá 111711, Colombia. vivi.clavijo@gmail.com.;Department of Biological Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Carrera 1#18A-12, Bogotá 111711, Colombia. cat-prad@uniandes.edu.co.;Department of Biological Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Carrera 1#18A-12, Bogotá 111711, Colombia. marcelamantilla08@gmail.com.;Department of Biological Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Carrera 1#18A-12, Bogotá 111711, Colombia. gomez_katika@hotmail.com.;Phage Lab, the Evergreen State College, Olympia, Washington, DC 98505, USA.

AlgR is a key transcriptional regulator required for the expression of multiple virulence factors, including type IV pili and alginate in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the regulon and molecular regulatory mechanism of AlgR have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, among 157 loci that were identified by a ChIP-seq assay, we characterized a gene, mucR, which encodes an enzyme that synthesizes the intracellular second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP). A ΔalgR strain produced lesser biofilm than did the wild-type strain, which is consistent with a phenotype controlled by c-di-GMP. AlgR positively regulates mucR via direct binding to its promoter. A ΔalgRΔmucR double mutant produced lesser biofilm than did the single ΔalgR mutant, demonstrating that c-di-GMP is a positive regulator of biofilm formation. AlgR controls the levels of c-di-GMP synthesis via direct regulation of mucR. In addition, the cognate sensor of AlgR, FimS/AlgZ, also plays an important role in P. aeruginosa virulence. Taken together, this study provides new insights into the AlgR regulon and reveals the involvement of c-di-GMP in the mechanism underlying AlgR regulation.	43	17	8268-82	10.1093/nar/gkv747	Kong;Zhao;Kang;Zhu;Zhou;Deng;Liang	Weina;Jingru;Huaping;Miao;Tianhong;Xin;Haihua	Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, ShaanXi 710069, China.;Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, ShaanXi 710069, China.;Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, ShaanXi 710069, China.;Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, ShaanXi 710069, China.;Key Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Technology, Ministry of Education, TEDA Institute of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Nankai University, 23 Hongda Street, Tianjin 300457, China.;Key Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Technology, Ministry of Education, TEDA Institute of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Nankai University, 23 Hongda Street, Tianjin 300457, China dengxindx@gmail.com.;Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, ShaanXi 710069, China lianghh@nwu.edu.cn.	eng	FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2012 Jul;36(4):893-916;J Bacteriol. 1996 Apr;178(7):1800-8;Infect Immun. 2013 Aug;81(8):2705-13;Int J Mol Sci. 2013;14(10):20983-1005;J Bacteriol. 2013 Dec;195(24):5499-515;PLoS Pathog. 2014 Mar;10(3):e1003984;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014;42(16):10307-20;Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2003 Dec;1(4):609-18;J Bacteriol. 1987 Jan;169(1):351-8;Infect Immun. 1987 Aug;55(8):1813-8;J Bacteriol. 1989 Mar;171(3):1278-83;J Bacteriol. 1989 Jul;171(7):3680-8;J Bacteriol. 1990 May;172(5):2511-20;J Antimicrob Chemother. 1990 Apr;25(4):585-91;J Bacteriol. 1991 Feb;173(4):1406-13;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Mar 1;88(5):1760-4;J Biol Chem. 1991 May 25;266(15):9754-63;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Sep 3;93(18):9839-43;Microbiol Rev. 1996 Sep;60(3):539-74;Mol Microbiol. 1997 Jun;24(6):1275-84;Gene. 1998 May 28;212(1):77-86;Mol Microbiol. 1998 Oct;30(2):295-304;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Oct 4;102(40):14422-7;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Apr 25;97(9):4885-90;APMIS. 2006 Feb;114(2):131-8;J Bacteriol. 2001 Sep;183(18):5395-401;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2001 Nov 27;205(1):17-23;J Bacteriol. 2002 Aug;184(16):4544-54;Infect Immun. 2002 Nov;70(11):6083-93;Trends Microbiol. 2003 Aug;11(8):359-66;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Dec;50(5):1477-91;J Biol Chem. 2004 Mar 5;279(10):8761-8;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2004 Feb;2(2):95-108;J Bacteriol. 2004 Sep;186(17):5672-84;J Bacteriol. 2004 Oct;186(20):6837-44;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2839-44;J Biomol Tech. 2006 Apr;17(2):103-13;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 8;104(19):8107-12;J Bacteriol. 2007 Nov;189(21):7752-64;J Bacteriol. 2008 Mar;190(6):2023-30;Microbiology. 2008 Jul;154(Pt 7):2119-30;Mol Microbiol. 2008 Jul;69(2):376-89;J Bacteriol. 2008 Sep;190(18):6217-27;Genome Biol. 2008;9(9):R137;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2009 Feb;75(4):1110-20;Bioinformatics. 2009 May 1;25(9):1105-11;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jul;37(Web Server issue):W202-8;J Bacteriol. 2010 Oct;192(20):5390-401;Environ Microbiol. 2011 May;13(5):1125-37;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jul 26;108(30):12467-72;Curr Issues Mol Biol. 2012;14(2):47-70;PLoS Pathog. 2012;8(3):e1002621;PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e38148;Mol Microbiol. 1991 Oct;5(10):2503-9;J Clin Invest. 1992 Sep;90(3):1085-92;J Bacteriol. 1992 Oct;174(20):6624-33;APMIS Suppl. 1992;28:1-79;Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1993 Aug;30(6):1021-34;Plasmid. 1994 May;31(3):265-74;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Aug 15;92(17):7941-5;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Sep 26;92(20):9427-31;J Bacteriol. 1996 Jan;178(2):511-23;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2013 Mar;77(1):1-52	MEDLINE	ppublish

Phenotypic variability among bacteria depends on gene expression in response to different environments, and it also reflects differences in genomic structure. In this study, we analyzed transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles of 151 Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates under standard laboratory conditions and of one P. aeruginosa type strain under 14 different environmental conditions. Our approach allowed dissection of the impact of the genetic background versus environmental cues on P. aeruginosa gene expression profiles and revealed that phenotypic variation was larger in response to changing environments than between genomically different isolates. We demonstrate that mutations within the global regulator LasR affect more than one trait (pleiotropy) and that the interaction between mutations (epistasis) shapes the P. aeruginosa phenotypic plasticity landscape. Because of pleiotropic and epistatic effects, average genotype and phenotype measures appeared to be uncorrelated in P. aeruginosa.;This work links experimental data of unprecedented complexity with evolution theory and delineates the transcriptional landscape of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that gene expression profiles are most strongly influenced by environmental cues, while at the same time the transcriptional profiles were also shaped considerably by genetic variation within global regulators. The comprehensive set of transcriptomic and genomic data of more than 150 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates will be made publically accessible to all researchers via a dedicated web interface. Both Pseudomonas specialists interested in expression and regulation of specific genes and researchers from other fields with more global interest in the phenotypic and genotypic variation of this important model species can access all information on various levels of detail.	6	4	e00749	10.1128/mBio.00749-15	Dötsch;Schniederjans;Khaledi;Hornischer;Schulz;Bielecka;Eckweiler;Pohl;Häussler	Andreas;Monika;Ariane;Klaus;Sebastian;Agata;Denitsa;Sarah;Susanne	andreas.doetsch@kit.edu.	eng	Nature. 2009 Oct 29;461(7268):1243-7;PLoS Comput Biol. 2008 Feb;4(2):e23;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2010 Feb 27;365(1540):547-56;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 8;104(19):8101-6;Science. 1999 May 21;284(5418):1318-22;Environ Microbiol. 1999 Oct;1(5):421-30;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Feb 4;100(3):1072-7;J Bacteriol. 2003 Dec;185(24):7222-30;J Bacteriol. 2014 Jan;196(2):345-56;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jan 1;33(Database issue):D338-43;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Microb Inform Exp. 2011 Jun 14;1(1):3;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2014 Jul;356(2):235-41;Microbes Infect. 2000 Jul;2(9):1051-60;Nat Rev Genet. 2003 Jun;4(6):457-69;Environ Microbiol. 2013 Feb;15(2):570-87;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 May 3;108(18):7481-6;J Bacteriol. 2003 Feb;185(4):1316-25;Trends Microbiol. 2000 Feb;8(2):55-7;Environ Microbiol. 2005 Jul;7(7):969-80;Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol. 1957;22:395-408;J Med Microbiol. 2004 Sep;53(Pt 9):841-53;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Feb;42(2):554-62;Bioessays. 2007 Sep;29(9):846-60;J Bacteriol. 2000 Jun;182(11):3125-35;Int J Med Microbiol. 2006 Apr;296(2-3):73-81;Nat Rev Genet. 2007 Dec;8(12):921-31;Genome Res. 2011 Jun;21(6):936-9;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Apr;64(2):512-33;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2011 Jul;35(4):652-80;PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31092;BMC Bioinformatics. 2014;15 Suppl 2:S2;BMC Genomics. 2010;11:234;Nature. 1999 Dec 2;402(6761 Suppl):C47-52;PLoS Pathog. 2015 Mar;11(3):e1004744;Front Microbiol. 2011 Jul 13;2:150;Phys Biol. 2005 Jun;2(2):81-8;PLoS One. 2014;9(2):e87991;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 May 7;110(19):7766-71;Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jan 7;41(1):1-20;Appl Microbiol. 1974 Dec;28(6):987-91	MEDLINE	epublish
142	26115051	2015				Electronic-eCollection	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	PloS one	PLoS ONE	1932-6203	Investigation of a Large Collection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Bacteriophages Collected from a Single Environmental Source in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.	Twenty two distinct bacteriophages were isolated from sewage water from five locations in the city of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire over a two-year period, using a collection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains with diverse genotypes. The phages were characterized by their virulence spectrum on a panel of selected P. aeruginosa strains from cystic fibrosis patients and by whole genome sequencing. Twelve virions representing the observed diversity were visualised by electron microscopy. The combined observations showed that 17 phages, distributed into seven genera, were virulent, and that five phages were related to temperate phages belonging to three genera. Some showed similarity with known phages only at the protein level. The vast majority of the genetic variations among virulent phages from the same genus resulted from seemingly non-random horizontal transfer events, inside a population of P. aeruginosa phages with limited diversity. This suggests the existence of a single environmental reservoir or ecotype in which continuous selection is taking place. In contrast, mostly point mutations were observed among phages potentially capable of lysogenisation. This is the first study of P. aeruginosa phage diversity in an African city and it shows that a large variety of phage species can be recovered in a limited geographical site at least when different bacterial strains are used. The relative temporal and spatial stability of the Abidjan phage population might reflect equilibrium in the microbial community from which they are released.	10	6	e0130548	10.1371/journal.pone.0130548	Essoh;Latino;Midoux;Blouin;Loukou;Nguetta;Lathro;Cablanmian;Kouassi;Vergnaud;Pourcel	Christiane;Libera;Cédric;Yann;Guillaume;Simon-Pierre A;Serge;Arsher;Athanase K;Gilles;Christine	Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell, CEA, CNRS, Univ Paris-Sud, Université Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.;Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell, CEA, CNRS, Univ Paris-Sud, Université Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.;Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell, CEA, CNRS, Univ Paris-Sud, Université Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.;Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell, CEA, CNRS, Univ Paris-Sud, Université Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.;Laboratoire National de Santé Publique, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire; Laboratoire de Bactériologie-Virologie, département de Sciences pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, Univ Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.;Laboratoire de Génétique, Département des Biosciences, Univ Félix Houphouet-Boigny, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.;Laboratoire National de Santé Publique, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.;Laboratoire National de Santé Publique, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.;Laboratoire National de Santé Publique, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.;Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell, CEA, CNRS, Univ Paris-Sud, Université Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France; ENSTA ParisTech, Université Paris-Saclay, Palaiseau, France.;Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell, CEA, CNRS, Univ Paris-Sud, Université Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.	eng	PLoS One. 2014;9(1):e86935;Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2012 Sep;31(9):2247-56;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2012 Sep;78(17):6380-5;J Bacteriol. 2006 Oct;188(19):6924-31;Viruses. 2013 Jan;5(1):15-53;Virology. 2008 Aug 1;377(2):233-8;Microbiology. 2011 Feb;157(Pt 2):430-7;Arch Virol. 2012 Apr;157(4):733-8;PLoS One. 2014;9(4):e93777;PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60575;Med Mal Infect. 2008 Aug;38(8):426-30;J Bacteriol. 2008 Feb;190(4):1429-35;PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e47742;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:75;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104;J Mol Biol. 2002 Mar 29;317(3):337-59;Mol Microbiol. 1995 Feb;15(3):415-20;Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2010 Jan;11(1):69-86;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):821-9;Bacteriophage. 2011 Jan;1(1):25-30;BMC Microbiol. 2011;11:102;PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e51163;J Microbiol Methods. 2009 May;77(2):207-13;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Mar;39(5):1237-47;Virol J. 2011;8:134;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):400-10;Future Microbiol. 2010 Jul;5(7):1041-55;Nature. 2013 Jan 17;493(7432):429-32;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Oct 29;99(22):14250-5;Environ Microbiol. 2005 Jul;7(7):1029-38;Adv Virus Res. 2014;88:227-78;Eur Respir J. 2012 Jul;40(1):227-38;J Bacteriol. 2009 Jan;191(1):210-9;Microbes Infect. 2000 Jul;2(9):1051-60;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2775-7;J Bacteriol. 2012 Nov;194(21):5728-38;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jul 15;30(14):3059-66;J Clin Microbiol. 2007 Oct;45(10):3175-83;MBio. 2014;5(2):e00896;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2013 Aug;68(8):1763-71;Virology. 2003 Jul 20;312(1):49-59;Trends Microbiol. 2005 Jun;13(6):278-84;Bacteriophage. 2011 Mar;1(2):66-85;Cell Microbiol. 2007 Feb;9(2):479-91;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004;32(1):11-6;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2010 Apr;76(8):2673-7;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2874-83;F1000 Biol Rep. 2012;4:17;J Virol. 2012 Sep;86(17):9537;Virology. 2010 Sep 15;405(1):26-30;Adv Appl Microbiol. 2014;89:135-83;MBio. 2012;3(2):e00029-12;Virus Res. 2014 Aug 30;189:43-6;Mol Gen Genet. 1985;200(1):123-7;Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Jul;38(12):3952-62;Curr Opin Virol. 2011 Oct;1(4):298-303;Nucleic Acids Res. 1977;4(5):1429-48;Virology. 2009 Aug 15;391(1):1-4;J Comput Biol. 2010 Nov;17(11):1519-33;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2012 Jun;94(6):1609-17;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(3):1184-7;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2012 Jun;78(12):4510-5;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Jun;71(6):3119-25;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007 Feb;51(2):446-52;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2004 Sep;68(3):560-602, table of contents;Nature. 2005 Sep 15;437(7057):356-61;BMC Microbiol. 2010;10:301;PLoS One. 2011;6(2):e16963;PLoS One. 2015;10(1):e0117163;Emerg Infect Dis. 2014 Jan;20(1):21-8;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2004 May;28(2):127-81;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2006 May;30(3):321-81;PLoS One. 2013;8(5):e62933;J Bacteriol. 2003 Oct;185(20):6220-3;Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2014;4:39;Arch Virol. 2014 Mar;159(3):567-72	MEDLINE	epublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen displaying high antibiotic resistance. Its resistance is in part due to its outstanding ability to form biofilms on a range of biotic and abiotic surfaces leading to difficult-to-treat, often long-term infections. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a new, promising antibacterial treatment to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Plasma is ionized gas that has antibacterial properties through the generation of a mix of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), excited molecules, charged particles and UV photons. Our results show the efficient removal of P. aeruginosa biofilms using a plasma jet (kINPen med), with no viable cells detected after 5 min treatment and no attached biofilm cells visible with confocal microscopy after 10 min plasma treatment. Because of its multi-factorial action, it is widely presumed that the development of bacterial resistance to plasma is unlikely. However, our results indicate that a short plasma treatment (3 min) may lead to the emergence of a small number of surviving cells exhibiting enhanced resistance to subsequent plasma exposure. Interestingly, these cells also exhibited a higher degree of resistance to hydrogen peroxide. Whole genome comparison between surviving cells and control cells revealed 10 distinct polymorphic regions, including four belonging to the redox active, antibiotic pigment phenazine. Subsequently, the interaction between phenazine production and CAP resistance was demonstrated in biofilms of transposon mutants disrupted in different phenazine pathway genes which exhibited significantly altered sensitivity to CAP.	10	6	e0130373	10.1371/journal.pone.0130373	Mai-Prochnow;Bradbury;Ostrikov;Murphy	Anne;Mark;Kostya;Anthony B	CSIRO Manufacturing Flagship, P.O.

Two-component systems (TCS) serve as stimulus-response coupling mechanisms to allow organisms to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes for more than 100 TCS components. To avoid unwanted cross-talk, signaling cascades are very specific, with one sensor talking to its cognate response regulator (RR). However, cross-regulation may provide means to integrate different environmental stimuli into a harmonized output response. By applying a split luciferase complementation assay, we identified a functional interaction of two RRs of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily, namely PhoB and TctD in P. aeruginosa. Transcriptional profiling, ChIP-seq analysis and a global motif scan uncovered the regulons of the two RRs as well as a quadripartite binding motif in six promoter regions. Phosphate limitation resulted in PhoB-dependent expression of the downstream genes, whereas the presence of TctD counteracted this activation. Thus, the integration of two important environmental signals e.g. phosphate availability and the carbon source are achieved by a titration of the relative amounts of two phosphorylated RRs that inversely regulate a common subset of genes. In conclusion, our results on the PhoB and TctD mediated two-component signal transduction pathways exemplify how P. aeruginosa may exploit cross-regulation to adapt bacterial behavior to complex environments.	43	13	6413-25	10.1093/nar/gkv599	Bielecki;Jensen;Schulze;Gödeke;Strehmel;Eckweiler;Nicolai;Bielecka;Wille;Gerlach;Häussler	Piotr;Vanessa;Wiebke;Julia;Janine;Denitsa;Tanja;Agata;Thorsten;Roman G;Susanne	Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Centre for Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Feodor-Lynen-Strasse 7, 30625 Hannover, Germany.;Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Centre for Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Feodor-Lynen-Strasse 7, 30625 Hannover, Germany.;Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Centre for Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Feodor-Lynen-Strasse 7, 30625 Hannover, Germany.;Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Centre for Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Feodor-Lynen-Strasse 7, 30625 Hannover, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology; Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Inhoffenstrasse 7, Braunschweig 38124, Germany.;Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Centre for Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Feodor-Lynen-Strasse 7, 30625 Hannover, Germany Department of Molecular Bacteriology; Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Inhoffenstrasse 7, Braunschweig 38124, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology; Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Inhoffenstrasse 7, Braunschweig 38124, Germany.;Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Centre for Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Feodor-Lynen-Strasse 7, 30625 Hannover, Germany Department of Molecular Bacteriology; Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Inhoffenstrasse 7, Braunschweig 38124, Germany.;Junior Research Group 3, Robert Koch-Institute, Wernigerode Branch, Burgstrasse 37, 38855 Wernigerode, Germany.;Junior Research Group 3, Robert Koch-Institute, Wernigerode Branch, Burgstrasse 37, 38855 Wernigerode, Germany.;Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Centre for Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Feodor-Lynen-Strasse 7, 30625 Hannover, Germany Department of Molecular Bacteriology; Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Inhoffenstrasse 7, Braunschweig 38124, Germany susanne.haeussler@helmholtz-hzi.de.	eng	Genes Cells. 2000 Jul;5(7):555-69;J Bacteriol. 2014 Jan;196(2):345-56;Anal Chem. 2001 Jun 1;73(11):2516-21;Methods. 2001 Dec;25(4):402-8;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Jan;47(2):303-20;Trends Microbiol. 2003 Aug;11(8):359-66;Gene. 1989 Apr 15;77(1):51-9;J Bacteriol. 1989 Aug;171(8):4436-41;J Bacteriol. 1990 May;172(5):2433-8;Mol Gen Genet. 1991 Jul;227(3):385-90;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Jan 15;89(2):718-22;Genes Cells. 1997 Mar;2(3):167-84;Gene. 1998 May 28;212(1):77-86;Gene. 1999 Feb 18;227(2):197-203;Microbiology. 1999 Mar;145 ( Pt 3):603-11;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Nov 9;101(45):15833-9;Trends Biochem Sci. 2005 Feb;30(2):70-2;Nat Methods. 2005 Jun;2(6):443-8;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Jul;71(7):3427-32;BMC Microbiol. 2005;5:30;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Feb;59(4):1199-215;Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1495-511;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8;Nat Methods. 2006 Dec;3(12):977-9;J Bacteriol. 2006 Dec;188(24):8601-6;J Bacteriol. 2007 Feb;189(3):929-39;Mol Microbiol. 2008 Sep;69(6):1358-72;Genome Biol. 2008;9(9):R137;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Apr 14;106(15):6327-32;Genome Biol. 2009;10(3):R25;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jul;37(Web Server issue):W202-8;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2010;64:539-59;Curr Opin Struct Biol. 2010 Dec;20(6):763-71;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;PLoS One. 2011;6(3):e18184;Genome Res. 2011 Jun;21(6):936-9;Methods Mol Biol. 2012;804:15-33;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2012 Jan;78(1):250-7;PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31092;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2012;66:325-47;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2013 Apr;16(2):156-62;Annu Rev Biochem. 2000;69:183-215	MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriol.	1098-5530	Links between Anr and Quorum Sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms.	In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the transcription factor Anr controls the cellular response to low oxygen or anoxia. Anr activity is high in oxygen-limited environments, including biofilms and populations associated with chronic infections, and Anr is necessary for persistence in a model of pulmonary infection. In this study, we characterized the Anr regulon in biofilm-grown cells at 1% oxygen in the laboratory strain PAO1 and in a quorum sensing (QS)-deficient clinical isolate, J215. As expected, transcripts related to denitrification, arginine fermentation, high-affinity cytochrome oxidases, and CupA fimbriae were lower in the Δanr derivatives. In addition, we observed that transcripts associated with quorum sensing regulation, iron acquisition and storage, type VI secretion, and the catabolism of aromatic compounds were also differentially expressed in the Δanr strains. Prior reports have shown that quorum sensing-defective mutants have higher levels of denitrification, and we found that multiple Anr-regulated processes, including denitrification, were strongly inversely proportional to quorum sensing in both transcriptional and protein-based assays. We also found that in LasR-defective strains but not their LasR-intact counterparts, Anr regulated the production of the 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines, which play roles in quorum sensing and interspecies interactions. These data show that Anr was required for the expression of important metabolic pathways in low-oxygen biofilms, and they reveal an expanded and compensatory role for Anr in the regulation of virulence-related genes in quorum sensing mutants, such as those commonly isolated from infections.;Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes acute ocular, soft tissue, and pulmonary infections, as well as chronic infections in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa uses quorum sensing (QS) to regulate virulence, but mutations in the gene encoding the master regulator of QS, lasR, are frequently observed in clinical isolates. We demonstrated that the regulon attributed to Anr, an oxygen-sensitive transcription factor, was more highly expressed in lasR mutants. Furthermore, we show that Anr regulates the production of several different secreted factors in lasR mutants. These data demonstrate the importance of Anr in naturally occurring quorum sensing mutants in the context of chronic infections.	197	17	2810-20	10.1128/JB.00182-15	Hammond;Dolben;Smith;Bhuju;Hogan	John H;Emily F;T Jarrod;Sabin;Deborah A	Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA dhogan@dartmouth.edu.	eng	J Biol Chem. 1996 Feb 2;271(5):2762-8;Mol Microbiol. 1998 May;28(3):449-61;Mol Microbiol. 1998 Aug;29(4):985-97;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Dec;62(6):1689-99;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Apr;64(2):512-33;Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2007 Jul;28(7):825-31;J Bacteriol. 2007 Jul;189(13):4969-72;Environ Microbiol. 2007 Oct;9(10):2475-85;Infect Immun. 2007 Nov;75(11):5313-24;J Bacteriol. 2007 Dec;189(23):8667-76;Nat Biotechnol. 2008 Mar;26(3):317-25;Biostatistics. 2008 Apr;9(2):321-32;J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(8):2739-58;J Biol Chem. 2008 Jun 6;283(23):15558-67;Mol Biosyst. 2008 Sep;4(9):882-8;J Bacteriol. 2008 Dec;190(24):7947-56;J Cyst Fibros. 2009 Jan;8(1):66-70;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Jul;65(1):153-65;Infect Immun. 2007 Aug;75(8):3715-21;EMBO J. 2007 Aug 8;26(15):3662-72;Microbiology. 2009 Mar;155(Pt 3):712-23;Trends Microbiol. 2009 Mar;17(3):130-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Apr 14;106(15):6339-44;Curr Opin Pulm Med. 2009 Mar;15(2):138-42;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2009 Jun;296(2):241-7;Microbiology. 2009 Sep;155(Pt 9):2845-55;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Sep;73(6):1072-85;Bioinformatics. 2010 Jan 1;26(1):139-40;PLoS Pathog. 2010 Jan;6(1):e1000712;Nature. 2010 May 20;465(7296):355-8;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jun;12(6):1719-33;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jun;12(6):1399-412;Mol Microbiol. 2010 Sep;77(6):1527-38;Microbiology. 2010 Oct;156(Pt 10):3096-107;Int J Med Microbiol. 2010 Dec;300(8):549-56;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;Biometals. 2011 Jun;24(3):523-32;Nature. 2000 Oct 12;407(6805):762-4;J Bacteriol. 2000 Dec;182(24):6940-9;Microbes Infect. 2001 Jan;3(1):23-35;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2001 Apr;67(4):1865-73;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jun 5;98(12):6911-6;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Sep 28;96(20):11229-34;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jan;187(2):554-66;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jul;187(14):4875-83;Infect Immun. 2005 Aug;73(8):4614-9;J Bacteriol. 2006 Jan;188(2):659-68;Int J Med Microbiol. 2006 Apr;296(2-3):73-81;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2006 Jul;72(7):5027-36;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Dec 26;103(52):19890-5;J Bacteriol. 2007 Mar;189(6):2262-73;Mol Microbiol. 2011 May;80(4):868-85;J Bacteriol. 2011 Nov;193(22):6152-61;J Bacteriol. 2011 Dec;193(23):6770-80;Science. 2011 Nov 18;334(6058):982-6;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2012 Mar;76(1):46-65;J Biol Chem. 2012 Aug 3;287(32):27095-105;Nat Methods. 2012 Jul;9(7):671-5;PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e46754;PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60973;Nature. 2013 Apr 25;496(7446):508-12;J Bacteriol. 2013 Jul;195(13):3093-104;PLoS Pathog. 2013;9(9):e1003582;Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2013 Oct;32(10):1231-52;MBio. 2014;5(2):e00992;Microbiology. 2014 Oct;160(Pt 10):2215-25;PLoS Pathog. 2014 Nov;10(11):e1004479;Pediatr Pulmonol. 2001 Oct;32(4):277-87;J Clin Invest. 2002 Feb;109(3):317-25;Semin Respir Infect. 2002 Mar;17(1):47-56;Dev Cell. 2002 Oct;3(4):593-603;J Bacteriol. 2003 Apr;185(7):2066-79;J Bacteriol. 2003 Apr;185(7):2080-95;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Feb;51(3):675-90;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Feb;42(2):554-62;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jul;186(14):4596-604;J Med Microbiol. 2004 Sep;53(Pt 9):841-53;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2004 Oct;70(10):6188-96;Mol Microbiol. 1990 Feb;4(2):315-9;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;Arch Microbiol. 1991;156(6):463-70;J Antimicrob Chemother. 1992 Nov;30(5):615-23;J Bacteriol. 1995 Jun;177(12):3606-9	MEDLINE	ppublish

N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most abundant internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA). Recent discoveries of demethylases and specific binding proteins of m(6)A as well as m(6)A methylomes obtained in mammals, yeast and plants have revealed regulatory functions of this RNA modification. Although m(6)A is present in the ribosomal RNA of bacteria, its occurrence in mRNA still remains elusive. Here, we have employed ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QQQ-MS/MS) to calculate the m(6)A/A ratio in mRNA from a wide range of bacterial species, which demonstrates that m(6)A is an abundant mRNA modification in tested bacteria. Subsequent transcriptome-wide m(6)A profiling in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed a conserved m(6)A pattern that is distinct from those in eukaryotes. Most m(6)A peaks are located inside open reading frames and carry a unique consensus motif of GCCAU. Functional enrichment analysis of bacterial m(6)A peaks indicates that the majority of m(6)A-modified genes are associated with respiration, amino acids metabolism, stress response and small RNAs, suggesting potential functional roles of m(6)A in these pathways.	43	13	6557-67	10.1093/nar/gkv596	Deng;Chen;Luo;Weng;Ji;Zhou;He	Xin;Kai;Guan-Zheng;Xiaocheng;Quanjiang;Tianhong;Chuan	TEDA Institute of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Nankai University, 23 Hongda Street, Tianjin 300457, P.R.

We here describe two novel lytic phages, KT28 and KTN6, infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolated from a sewage sample from an irrigated field near Wroclaw, in Poland. Both viruses show characteristic features of Pbunalikevirus genus within the Myoviridae family with respect to shape and size of head/tail, as well as LPS host receptor recognition. Genome analysis confirmed the similarity to other PB1-related phages, ranging between 48 and 96%. Pseudomonas phage KT28 has a genome size of 66,381 bp and KTN6 of 65,994 bp. The latent period, burst size, stability and host range was determined for both viruses under standard laboratory conditions. Biofilm eradication efficacy was tested on peg-lid plate assay and PET membrane surface. Significant reduction of colony forming units was observed (70-90%) in 24 h to 72 h old Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm cultures for both phages. Furthermore, a pyocyanin and pyoverdin reduction tests reveal that tested phages lowers the amount of both secreted dyes in 48-72 h old biofilms. Diffusion and goniometry experiments revealed the increase of diffusion rate through the biofilm matrix after phage application. These characteristics indicate these phages could be used to prevent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections and biofilm formation. It was also shown, that PB1-related phage treatment of biofilm caused the emergence of stable phage-resistant mutants growing as small colony variants.	10	5	e0127603	10.1371/journal.pone.0127603	Danis-Wlodarczyk;Olszak;Arabski;Wasik;Majkowska-Skrobek;Augustyniak;Gula;Briers;Jang;Vandenheuvel;Duda;Lavigne;Drulis-Kawa	Katarzyna;Tomasz;Michal;Slawomir;Grazyna;Daria;Grzegorz;Yves;Ho Bin;Dieter;Katarzyna Anna;Rob;Zuzanna	Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Institute of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland; Division of Gene Technology, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Institute of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.;Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biology, The Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.;Department of Molecular Physics, Institute of Physics, The Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.;Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Institute of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.;Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Institute of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.;Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Institute of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.;Division of Gene Technology, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Division of Gene Technology, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Division of Gene Technology, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Division of Structural Biochemistry, Research Center Borstel, Leibniz-Center for Medicine and Biosciences, Borstel, Germany.;Division of Gene Technology, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Institute of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.	eng	Pathog Dis. 2013 Apr;67(3):159-73;Eur Biophys J. 2013 Jul;42(7):549-58;PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60575;Methods Mol Biol. 2009;501:141-9;J Inorg Biochem. 2003 Dec 1;97(4):384-7;J Bacteriol. 2008 Feb;190(4):1429-35;Microbiologyopen. 2013 Dec;2(6):1010-23;Infect Immun. 1992 Feb;60(2):328-36;BMC Microbiol. 2009;9:224;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2008 Aug;52(8):2870-81;J Bacteriol. 2000 Sep;182(18):5114-20;Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Jan;38(Database issue):D57-61;Methods Mol Biol. 2009;501:157-60;Am J Infect Control. 2005 Jun;33(5 Suppl 1):S41-9;Bioinformatics. 2004 Mar 22;20(5):629-35;J Bacteriol. 2002 Sep;184(17):4891-905;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):898-911;PLoS One. 2009;4(3):e4944;Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 Jan 1;34(Database issue):D247-51;Nat Methods. 2012 Jul;9(7):671-5;PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e46718;Int J Mol Sci. 2013;14(10):20983-1005;J Bacteriol. 2004 Aug;186(16):5523-8;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2009 Jul 15;180(2):138-45;Trends Microbiol. 2011 Oct;19(10):483-91;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jul;39(Web Server issue):W29-37;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2874-83;RNA Biol. 2011 Jan-Feb;8(1):11-3;J Immunol. 2005 Mar 15;174(6):3643-9;Bacteriophage. 2012 Jul 1;2(3):178-185;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;J Infect Chemother. 2009 Jun;15(3):125-42;Infect Immun. 1996 Feb;64(2):518-23;Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 1983;31(3):267-91;Mol Biol Evol. 2008 Apr;25(4):762-77;Bioinformatics. 1998;14(1):48-54;Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Feb 15;26(4):1107-15;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2011 May;90(3):851-9;J Microbiol Methods. 2009 May;77(2):178-83;Cell. 1999 Jan 8;96(1):47-56;Curr Opin Pediatr. 2007 Feb;19(1):83-8;J Microbiol Methods. 2000 Apr;40(2):175-9;Bioinformatics. 2005 Apr 1;21(7):951-60;J Virol. 1977 Sep;23(3):461-6;J Bacteriol. 2009 Dec;191(23):7206-15;BMC Microbiol. 2010;10:301;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Sep;61(5):1308-21;MBio. 2012;3(2). pii: e00061-12. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00061-12;Clin Otolaryngol. 2009 Aug;34(4):349-57;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W244-8;J Virol. 2013 Dec;87(23):12866-78;Infect Immun. 2000 May;68(5):2916-24;Bioinformatics. 2008 Jan 15;24(2):282-4	MEDLINE	epublish

152	25898829	2015	Apr	18		Electronic	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	BMC genomics	BMC Genomics	1471-2164	Pan-genome dynamics of Pseudomonas gene complements enriched across hexachlorocyclohexane dumpsite.	Phylogenetic heterogeneity across Pseudomonas genus is complemented by its diverse genome architecture enriched by accessory genetic elements (plasmids, transposons, and integrons) conferring resistance across this genus. Here, we sequenced a stress tolerant genotype i.e. Pseudomonas sp. strain RL isolated from a hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) contaminated pond (45 mg of total HCH g(-1) sediment) and further compared its gene repertoire with 17 reference ecotypes belonging to P. stutzeri, P. mendocina, P. aeruginosa, P. psychrotolerans and P. denitrificans, representing metabolically diverse ecosystems (i.e. marine, clinical, and soil/sludge). Metagenomic data from HCH contaminated pond sediment and similar HCH contaminated sites were further used to analyze the pan-genome dynamics of Pseudomonas genotypes enriched across increasing HCH gradient.;Although strain RL demonstrated clear species demarcation (ANI ≤ 80.03%) from the rest of its phylogenetic relatives, it was found to be closest to P. stutzeri clade which was further complemented functionally. Comparative functional analysis elucidated strain specific enrichment of metabolic pathways like α-linoleic acid degradation and carbazole degradation in Pseudomonas sp. strain RL and P. stutzeri XLDN-R, respectively. Composition based methods (%codon bias and %G + C difference) further highlighted the significance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in evolution of nitrogen metabolism, two-component system (TCS) and methionine metabolism across the Pseudomonas genomes used in this study. An intact mobile class-I integron (3,552 bp) with a captured gene cassette encoding for dihydrofolate reductase (dhfra1) was detected in strain RL, distinctly demarcated from other integron harboring species (i.e. P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. putida). Mobility of this integron was confirmed by its association with Tnp21-like transposon (95% identity) suggesting stress specific mobilization across HCH contaminated sites. Metagenomics data from pond sediment and recently surveyed HCH adulterated soils revealed the in situ enrichment of integron associated transposase gene (TnpA6100) across increasing HCH contamination (0.7 to 450 mg HCH g(-1) of soil).;Unlocking the potential of comparative genomics supplemented with metagenomics, we have attempted to resolve the environment and strain specific demarcations across 18 Pseudomonas gene complements. Pan-genome analyses of these strains indicate at astoundingly diverse metabolic strategies and provide genetic basis for the cosmopolitan existence of this taxon.	16		313	10.1186/s12864-015-1488-2	Sharma;Sangwan;Negi;Kohli;Khurana;Rao;Lal	Anukriti;Naseer;Vivek;Puneet;Jitendra Paul;Desiraju Lakshmi Narsimha;Rup	Department of Zoology, University of Delhi,

A major challenge in microbial biofilm control is biocide resistance. Phenotypic adaptations and physical protective effects have been historically thought to be the primary mechanisms for glutaraldehyde resistance in bacterial biofilms. Recent studies indicate the presence of genetic mechanisms for glutaraldehyde resistance, but very little is known about the contributory genetic factors. Here, we demonstrate that efflux pumps contribute to glutaraldehyde resistance in Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. The RNA-seq data show that efflux pumps and phosphonate degradation, lipid biosynthesis, and polyamine biosynthesis metabolic pathways were induced upon glutaraldehyde exposure. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of efflux pumps potentiates glutaraldehyde activity, suggesting that efflux activity contributes to glutaraldehyde resistance. Additionally, induction of known modulators of biofilm formation, including phosphonate degradation, lipid biosynthesis, and polyamine biosynthesis, may contribute to biofilm resistance and resilience. Fundamental understanding of the genetic mechanism of biocide resistance is critical for the optimization of biocide use and development of novel disinfection strategies. Our results reveal genetic components involved in glutaraldehyde resistance and a potential strategy for improved control of biofilms.	59	6	3433-40	10.1128/AAC.05152-14	Vikram;Bomberger;Bibby	Amit;Jennifer M;Kyle J	Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.;Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA Department of Computational and Systems Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA BibbyKJ@pitt.edu.	eng	J Antimicrob Chemother. 2002 Apr;49(4):597-9;Environ Sci Technol. 2014 Nov 4;48(21):13001-9;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1992 Jun;36(6):1208-14;Biofouling. 2011 Mar;27(3):337-46;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014 Nov;58(11):6424-31;Bioinformatics. 2003 Aug 12;19(12):1477-83;J Appl Microbiol. 2002;92 Suppl:55S-64S;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Feb;49(2):849-52;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Dec;53(12):5230-5;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2002 May;46(5):1469-74;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Sep;53(9):4015-8;Methods. 2001 Dec;25(4):402-8;J Bacteriol. 2006 Apr;188(7):2355-63;Nat Methods. 2008 Jul;5(7):621-8;J Hosp Infect. 2010 Nov;76(3):200-5;J Bacteriol. 2002 Feb;184(4):1140-54;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 Jun;55(6):2648-54;J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol. 2002 Jul;29(1):10-5;Microbiology. 2003 Mar;149(Pt 3):707-14;J Hosp Infect. 2013 Aug;84(4):316-8;Biotechnol Bioeng. 2008 May 1;100(1):1-18;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jul 12;108(28):11393-8;J Biol Chem. 2010 Dec 10;285(50):39224-38;J Biol Chem. 2009 Apr 10;284(15):9899-907;Curr Med Chem. 2011;18(19):2969-80;BMC Genomics. 2013;14:350;J Hosp Infect. 2011 Jul;78(3):163-70;J Med Microbiol. 2008 Aug;57(Pt 8):966-73;Infect Immun. 2014 Sep;82(9):3764-74;Genome Biol. 2010;11(3):R25;J Bacteriol. 2001 Jun;183(11):3268-75;J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol. 2006 Sep;33(9):741-9;Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2011 Dec;32(12):1173-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Jul;54(7):2920-7;Scientifica (Cairo). 2014;2014:231083;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2008 Dec;52(12):4478-82;J Bacteriol. 2012 Feb;194(4):813-26;J Hosp Infect. 2007 Jun;65 Suppl 2:60-72;Environ Microbiol. 2011 Apr;13(4):1078-90;Biofouling. 2011 Oct;27(9):1017-32;Methods Mol Biol. 2000;132:365-86;Clin Microbiol Rev. 1999 Jan;12(1):147-79;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jul;12(7):2034-47;J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol. 2001 Apr;3(2):255-64;Int J Food Microbiol. 2010 Jun 15;140(2-3):109-16;BMC Microbiol. 2012;12:261;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2011 May;66(5):1036-43;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Jan;45(1):105-16;Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2013 Feb;22(2):191-206;Trends Microbiol. 2014 Jun;22(6):326-33;Mol Microbiol. 2011 Apr;80(1):195-218;Nat Protoc. 2009;4(1):44-57;N Engl J Med. 2003 Jan 16;348(3):214-20;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Feb;49(2):781-2;J Vis Exp. 2011;(47). pii: 2437. doi: 10.3791/2437;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Feb;45(2):428-32;In Vivo. 2006 May-Jun;20(3):361-6	MEDLINE	ppublish

Sigma factors are essential global regulators of transcription initiation in bacteria which confer promoter recognition specificity to the RNA polymerase core enzyme. They provide effective mechanisms for simultaneously regulating expression of large numbers of genes in response to challenging conditions, and their presence has been linked to bacterial virulence and pathogenicity. In this study, we constructed nine his-tagged sigma factor expressing and/or deletion mutant strains in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To uncover the direct and indirect sigma factor regulons, we performed mRNA profiling, as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing. We furthermore elucidated the de novo binding motif of each sigma factor, and validated the RNA- and ChIP-seq results by global motif searches in the proximity of transcriptional start sites (TSS). Our integrated approach revealed a highly modular network architecture which is composed of insulated functional sigma factor modules. Analysis of the interconnectivity of the various sigma factor networks uncovered a limited, but highly function-specific, crosstalk which orchestrates complex cellular processes. Our data indicate that the modular structure of sigma factor networks enables P. aeruginosa to function adequately in its environment and at the same time is exploited to build up higher-level functions by specific interconnections that are dominated by a participation of RpoN.	11	3	e1004744	10.1371/journal.ppat.1004744	Schulz;Eckweiler;Bielecka;Nicolai;Franke;Dötsch;Hornischer;Bruchmann;Düvel;Häussler	Sebastian;Denitsa;Agata;Tanja;Raimo;Andreas;Klaus;Sebastian;Juliane;Susanne	Institute for Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Center for Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, a joint venture of the Hannover Medical School and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Hannover, Germany;

The physiological resistance of pathogens to antimicrobial treatment is a severe problem in the context of chronic infections. For example, the mucus-filled lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are readily colonized by diverse antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Previously, we showed that bioavailable ferrous iron [Fe(II)] is present in CF sputum at all stages of infection and constitutes a significant portion of the iron pool at advanced stages of lung function decline [R. C. Hunter et al., mBio 4(4):e00557-13, 2013]. P. aeruginosa, a dominant CF pathogen, senses Fe(II) using a two-component signal transduction system, BqsRS, which is transcriptionally active in CF sputum [R. C. Hunter et al., mBio 4(4):e00557-13, 2013; N. N. Kreamer, J. C. Wilks, J. J. Marlow, M. L. Coleman, and D. K. Newman, J Bacteriol 194:1195-1204, 2012]. Here, we show that an RExxE motif in BqsS is required for BqsRS activation. Once Fe(II) is sensed, BqsR binds a tandem repeat DNA sequence, activating transcription. The BqsR regulon--defined through iterative bioinformatic predictions and experimental validation--includes several genes whose products are known to drive antibiotic resistance to aminoglycosides and polymyxins. Among them are genes encoding predicted determinants of polyamine transport and biosynthesis. Compared to the wild type, bqsS and bqsR deletion mutants are sensitive to high levels of Fe(II), produce less spermidine in high Fe(II), and are more sensitive to tobramycin and polymyxin B but not arsenate, chromate, or cefsulodin. BqsRS thus mediates a physiological response to Fe(II) that guards the cell against positively charged molecules but not negatively charged stressors. These results suggest Fe(II) is an important environmental signal that, via BqsRS, bolsters tolerance of a variety of cationic stressors, including clinically important antimicrobial agents.;Clearing chronic infections is challenging due to the physiological resistance of opportunistic pathogens to antibiotics. Effective treatments are hindered by a lack of understanding of how these organisms survive in situ. Fe(II) is typically present at micromolar levels in soils and sedimentary habitats, as well as in CF sputum. All P. aeruginosa strains possess a two-component system, BqsRS, that specifically senses extracellular Fe(II) at low micromolar concentrations. Our work shows that BqsRS protects the cell against cationic perturbations to the cell envelope as well as low pH and reduction potential (Eh), conditions under which Fe(2+) is stable. Fe(II) can thus be understood as a proxy for a broader environmental state; the cellular response to its detection may help rationalize the resistance of P. aeruginosa to clinically important cationic antibiotics. This finding demonstrates the importance of considering environmental chemistry when exploring mechanisms of microbial survival in habitats that include the human body.	6	2	e02549	10.1128/mBio.02549-14	Kreamer;Costa;Newman	Naomi N;Flavia;Dianne K	Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, Caltech, Pasadena, California, USA.;Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, Caltech, Pasadena, California, USA.;dkn@caltech.edu.	eng	Commun Integr Biol. 2008;1(1):88-96;Trends Microbiol. 2005 Jan;13(1):27-33;J Bacteriol. 2008 Jan;190(2):662-71;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2013 Jun;79(12):3619-27;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Oct;50(1):205-17;J Mol Biol. 1993 Jul 5;232(1):67-78;Mol Microbiol. 2011 Jan;79(1):63-75;J Bacteriol. 2000 Dec;182(23):6667-72;Structure. 2002 May;10(5):701-13;Bioinformatics. 2012 Oct 1;28(19):2532-3;Microbiol Rev. 1985 Mar;49(1):1-32;Mol Microbiol. 2008 Apr;68(1):4-16;Annu Rev Genet. 2007;41:121-45;J Bacteriol. 2011 Dec;193(23):6505-11;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 Dec;55(12):5761-9;J Bacteriol. 2012 Mar;194(5):1195-204;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Feb;49(2):479-87;MBio. 2013;4(4). pii: e00557-13. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00557-13;Science. 1996 Mar 15;271(5255):1552-7;J Clin Invest. 2002 Feb;109(3):317-25;Microbiology. 2004 Mar;150(Pt 3):516; discussion 516-8;Mol Biol Evol. 2008 Oct;25(10):2119-28;J Bacteriol. 2011 Jun;193(12):2989-99;Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jan;41(Database issue):D348-52;PLoS Pathog. 2012 Sep;8(9):e1002945;J Bacteriol. 1997 Jul;179(13):4328-35;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006 May;50(5):1615-22;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1988 Jul;32(7):1097-9;J Bacteriol. 1998 Jan;180(1):171-4;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2003 Apr;6(2):181-5;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2010 Apr;13(2):150-9;Protein Eng. 1997 Jun;10(6):673-6;Bioinformatics. 2014 Aug 1;30(15):2114-20;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 May 26;95(11):5857-64;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Jan 15;89(2):718-22;PLoS One. 2013;8(8):e71579;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Aug 2;102(31):11076-81;Bioinformatics. 2009 Aug 15;25(16):2078-9;Biochemistry (Mosc). 2003 Aug;68(8):850-6;J Bacteriol. 2007 Mar;189(6):2426-34;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jan 1;31(1):371-3;Mol Microbiol. 1999 Oct;34(2):305-16;J Bacteriol. 2012 Nov;194(22):6162-73;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jul;37(Web Server issue):W202-8;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1998 Jan;64(1):27-33;Genome Biol. 2014;15(2):R29;J Biol Chem. 1989 Nov 5;264(31):18693-700;Anal Biochem. 1987 Jul;164(1):261-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jan;42(Database issue):D222-30;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2010 Sep;34(5):611-27;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):575-9;J Bacteriol. 2006 Jun;188(11):3995-4006;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;J Bacteriol. 2012 Feb;194(4):813-26;Cell. 2000 Sep 29;103(1):113-25;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2007 Apr 15;175(8):822-8;Nat Chem Biol. 2006 Apr;2(4):171-4;Curr Microbiol. 2014 Jul;69(1):75-81;Genome Biol. 2009;10(3):R25;Environ Sci Technol. 2013 Mar 19;47(6):2602-11;J Appl Bacteriol. 1979 Dec;47(3):477-88;J Bacteriol. 2007 Jul;189(14):5002-11;J Biol Chem. 2002 Sep 6;277(36):32706-13;Curr Opin Pulm Med. 2001 Nov;7(6):434-40;Chest. 2006 May;129(5):1148-54;Biochemistry. 2007 Jul 10;46(27):8172-80;Trends Microbiol. 2001 Jan;9(1):34-9;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2009 Mar;33(2):279-94;Nature. 2009 Aug 13;460(7257):831-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2004 May;48(5):1892-4;Front Microbiol. 2014 Sep 18;5:489;Nat Protoc. 2009;4(1):44-57;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Sep;61(5):1308-21;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;75(21):6639-46;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1999 Feb;65(2):489-98;Appl Microbiol. 1974 Dec;28(6):987-91;Arch Biochem Biophys. 2003 Oct 15;418(2):125-32;Science. 1997 Oct 24;278(5338):631-7;PLoS One. 2014;9(1):e84353;Nucleic Acids Res. 2000 Jan 1;28(1):33-6;Nat Protoc. 2006;1(1):153-61	MEDLINE	epublish

Chem.	1083-351X	Paraoxonase 2 serves a proapopotic function in mouse and human cells in response to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing molecule N-(3-Oxododecanoyl)-homoserine lactone.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa use quorum-sensing molecules, including N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-homoserine lactone (C12), for intercellular communication. C12 activated apoptosis in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) from both wild type (WT) and Bax/Bak double knock-out mice (WT MEF and DKO MEF that were responsive to C12, DKOR MEF): nuclei fragmented; mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψmito) depolarized; Ca(2+) was released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), increasing cytosolic [Ca(2+)] (Cacyto); and caspase 3/7 was activated. DKOR MEF had been isolated from a nonclonal pool of DKO MEF that were non-responsive to C12 (DKONR MEF). RNAseq analysis, quantitative PCR, and Western blots showed that WT and DKOR MEF both expressed genes associated with cancer, including paraoxonase 2 (PON2), whereas DKONR MEF expressed little PON2. Adenovirus-mediated expression of human PON2 in DKONR MEF rendered them responsive to C12: Δψmito depolarized, Cacyto increased, and caspase 3/7 activated. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells expressed low levels of endogenous PON2, and these cells were also less responsive to C12. Overexpression of PON2, but not PON2-H114Q (no lactonase activity) in HEK293T cells caused them to become sensitive to C12. Because [C12] may reach high levels in biofilms in lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, PON2 lactonase activity may control Δψmito, Ca(2+) release from the ER, and apoptosis in CF airway epithelia. Coupled with previous data, these results also indicate that PON2 uses its lactonase activity to prevent Bax- and Bak-dependent apoptosis in response to common proapoptotic drugs like doxorubicin and staurosporine, but activates Bax- and Bak-independent apoptosis in response to C12.	290	11	7247-58	10.1074/jbc.M114.620039	Schwarzer;Fu;Morita;Whitt;Neely;Li;Machen	Christian;Zhu;Takeshi;Aaron G;Aaron M;Chi;Terry E	From the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720-3200 and.;From the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720-3200 and.;From the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720-3200 and.;the Departments of Medicine, Pharmacology, and Toxicology, Molecular Targets Program, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky 40202.;the Departments of Medicine, Pharmacology, and Toxicology, Molecular Targets Program, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky 40202.;the Departments of Medicine, Pharmacology, and Toxicology, Molecular Targets Program, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky 40202.;From the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720-3200 and tmachen@berkeley.edu.	eng	Bioinformatics. 2015 Jan 15;31(2):166-9;FASEB J. 2014 Apr;28(4):1769-79;PLoS One. 2012;7(7):e42241;J Biol Chem. 2013 Aug 16;288(33):23914-27;Am J Physiol Cell Physiol. 2014 May 1;306(9):C844-55;Oncogene. 2004 Jun 17;23(28):4894-902;Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2007 Nov;293(5):L1250-60;Cell Microbiol. 2006 Dec;8(12):1841-9;J Biol Chem. 2010 Aug 6;285(32):24398-403;J Lipid Res. 2005 Jun;46(6):1239-47;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;Bioinformatics. 2009 May 1;25(9):1105-11;Leukemia. 2006 Aug;20(8):1400-7;Cell Microbiol. 2012 May;14(5):698-709;Cancer Res. 2002 Jun 15;62(12):3562-71;Environ Microbiol. 2000 Oct;2(5):530-41;Blood. 2003 Oct 15;102(8):2951-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Aug 1;97(16):8789-93;PLoS Pathog. 2013;9(8):e1003576;Cell Death Dis. 2011;2:e112;J Immunol. 2014 Aug 1;193(3):1459-67;Infect Immun. 1998 Jan;66(1):36-42;Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2007 Apr;292(4):L852-60;Science. 2008 Jul 11;321(5886):259-63;Int J Med Microbiol. 2009 Nov;299(7):509-19;FEBS Lett. 1993 Dec 13;335(3):345-8;J Lipids. 2012;2012:352857;J Lipids. 2012;2012:342806;Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2004 May;11(5):412-9;J Ocul Biol Dis Infor. 2010 Jun;3(2):64-72;Cell Microbiol. 2014 Jul;16(7):1094-104;Cell Death Differ. 2012 Sep;19(9):1549-60;Infect Immun. 2003 Oct;71(10):5785-93;Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2010 Mar-Apr;7(2):51-60;Infect Immun. 2008 Jun;76(6):2512-9;Cell Microbiol. 2006 Oct;8(10):1601-10;J Biol Chem. 1985 Mar 25;260(6):3440-50;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2014 Apr 1;189(7):812-24;J Immunol. 2001 Jul 1;167(1):366-74;J Biol Chem. 2008 Oct 3;283(40):27144-53;J Clin Invest. 1995 Nov;96(5):2204-10;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2005 Mar 15;244(2):297-304;Microbes Infect. 2000 Nov;2(14):1721-31;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2005 Nov;29(5):935-47;J Bacteriol. 2004 Apr;186(8):2281-7;Antioxid Redox Signal. 2011 Feb 1;14(3):341-51;J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2002 Jul;128(7):369-79;Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2013 Oct;12(10):791-808;Cell Death Differ. 2011 Jan;18(1):38-47;Adv Exp Med Biol. 2014;824:33-41;Cell Microbiol. 2014 Jan;16(1):1-14;Biochem J. 2010 Feb 15;426(1):73-83;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Mar 9;101(10):3587-90;J Biol Chem. 2010 Nov 5;285(45):34850-63	MEDLINE	ppublish

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of using phages as a therapy against hemorrhagic pneumonia in mink both in vitro and in vivo. Five Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) strains were isolated from lungs of mink with suspected hemorrhagic pneumonia and their identity was confirmed by morphological observation and 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Compared to P. aeruginosa strains isolated from mink with hemorrhagic pneumonia in 2002, these isolates were more resistant to antibiotics selected. A lytic phage vB_PaeP_PPA-ABTNL (PPA-ABTNL) of the Podoviridae family was isolated from hospital sewage using a P. aeruginosa isolate as host, showing broad host range against P. aeruginosa. A one-step growth curve analysis of PPA-ABTNL revealed eclipse and latent periods of 20 and 35 min, respectively, with a burst size of about 110 PFU per infected cell. Phage PPA-ABTNL significantly reduced the growth of P. aeruginosa isolates in vitro. The genome of PPA-ABTNL was 43,227 bp (62.4% G+C) containing 54 open reading frames and lacked regions encoding known virulence factors, integration-related proteins and antibiotic resistance determinants. Genome architecture analysis showed that PPA-ABTNL belonged to the phiKMV-like Viruses group. A repeated dose inhalational toxicity study using PPA-ABTNL crude preparation was conducted in mice and no significantly abnormal histological changes, morbidity or mortality were observed. There was no indication of any potential risk associated with using PPA-ABTNL as a therapeutic agent. The results of a curative treatment experiment demonstrated that atomization by ultrasonic treatment could efficiently deliver phage to the lungs of mink and a dose of 10 multiplicity of infection was optimal for treating mink hemorrhagic pneumonia. Our work demonstrated the potential for phage to fight P. aeruginosa involved in mink lung infections when administered by means of ultrasonic nebulization.	10	1	e0116571	10.1371/journal.pone.0116571	Cao;Zhang;Niu;Cui;Ma;Cao;Jin;Li;Xu	Zhenhui;Jiancheng;Yan D;Naizhong;Yongsheng;Fang;Liji;Zhen;Yongping	School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China.;School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China.;Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development, Agriculture Centre, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.;School of Life Science, Datong University, Datong, Shanxi, China.;College of Food Science and Engineering, Dalian Ocean University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.;School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China.;School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China; Ministry of Education Center for Food Safety of Animal Origin, Dalian, Liaoning, China.;School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China.;School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China; Ministry of Education Center for Food Safety of Animal Origin, Dalian, Liaoning, China.	eng	J Bacteriol. 2006 Oct;188(19):6924-31;PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e34585;Nature. 1989 Aug 10;340(6233):467-8;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2005 Jun 1;171(11):1209-23;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2009 Jul;34(1):15-20;Vet Microbiol. 2013 Apr 12;163(1-2):103-9;Biotechnol Lett. 2007 Jul;29(7):995-1003;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2003 Oct;1(1):65-70;Chest. 2011 Apr;139(4):909-19;J Med Microbiol. 2009 Sep;58(Pt 9):1133-48;Res Microbiol. 2008 Jun;159(5):406-14;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:75;J Chem Inf Comput Sci. 2002 May-Jun;42(3):620-32;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104;Vet Microbiol. 2003 Jul 17;94(3):237-43;J Bacteriol. 2000 Sep;182(18):5114-20;J Pharm Pharmacol. 2011 Oct;63(10):1253-64;Prev Vet Med. 2012 Oct 1;106(3-4):332-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D129-35;J Appl Microbiol. 2011 Jul;111(1):1-7;Environ Toxicol Chem. 2013 Apr;32(4):780-93;J Gen Physiol. 1939 Jan 20;22(3):365-84;J Mol Biol. 2004 May 14;338(5):1027-36;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2003 Dec;56(6):600-12;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2011 May;77(10):3443-50;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2002 Apr;15(2):167-93;Vet Microbiol. 2010 Dec 15;146(3-4):309-13;Vet Microbiol. 2009 Jan 1;133(1-2):115-22;Virology. 2003 Jul 20;312(1):49-59;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Jul;49(7):2874-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004;32(1):11-6;J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv. 2013 Dec;26(6):317-35;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2009 Jul;33(4):801-19;Poult Sci. 2005 Apr;84(4):655-9;Can J Vet Res. 2013 Jul;77(3):199-204;PLoS One. 2011;6(2):e16963;Mol Biol Evol. 2007 Aug;24(8):1596-9;Clin Otolaryngol. 2009 Aug;34(4):349-57;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Mar;71(3):1387-93;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2004 May;28(2):127-81;Cell. 2002 Jan 11;108(1):13-6;Cell Mol Biol Lett. 2004;9(2):253-9;Bioinformatics. 2007 Nov 1;23(21):2947-8;Ann Biol Clin (Paris). 2011 Jul-Aug;69(4):393-403;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv. 2008 Dec;21(4):351-60;Emerg Infect Dis. 1998 Oct-Dec;4(4):551-60	MEDLINE	epublish

Bacteriophages that infect the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been classified into several groups. One of them, which includes temperate phage particles with icosahedral heads and long flexible tails, bears genomes whose architecture and replication mechanism, but not their nucleotide sequences, are like those of coliphage Mu. By comparing the genomic sequences of this group of P. aeruginosa phages one could draw conclusions about their ontogeny and evolution.;Two newly isolated Mu-like phages of P. aeruginosa are described and their genomes sequenced and compared with those available in the public data banks. The genome sequences of the two phages are similar to each other and to those of a group of P. aeruginosa transposable phages. Comparing twelve of these genomes revealed a common genomic architecture in the group. Each phage genome had numerous genes with homologues in all the other genomes and a set of variable genes specific for each genome. The first group, which comprised most of the genes with assigned functions, was named core genome, and the second group, containing mostly short ORFs without assigned functions was called accessory genome. Like in other phage groups, variable genes are confined to specific regions in the genome.;Based on the known and inferred functions for some of the variable genes of the phages analyzed here, they appear to confer selective advantages for the phage survival under particular host conditions. We speculate that phages have developed a mechanism for horizontally acquiring genes to incorporate them at specific loci in the genome that help phage adaptation to the selective pressures imposed by the host.	15		1146	10.1186/1471-2164-15-1146	Cazares;Mendoza-Hernández;Guarneros	Adrián;Guillermo;Gabriel	Departamento de Genética y Biología Molecular, Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CINVESTAV IPN), Mexico City, Mexico. gguarner@cinvestav.mx.	eng	Mol Cell. 2004 Oct 8;16(1):11-21;J Virol. 2012 Mar;86(6):3400-1;J Proteome Res. 2004 Sep-Oct;3(5):958-64;Nature. 1979 Jul 19;280(5719):247-50;Environ Microbiol. 2013 May;15(5):1356-76;J Bacteriol. 1990 Apr;172(4):1899-904;Trends Microbiol. 2000 Nov;8(11):504-8;Crit Rev Microbiol. 2013 Nov;39(4):427-34;J Mol Biol. 2000 May 26;299(1):27-51;PLoS Genet. 2008 May;4(5):e1000065;Microbiology. 2007 Sep;153(Pt 9):2885-95;Res Microbiol. 2007 Dec;158(10):724-36;J Mol Biol. 2002 Mar 29;317(3):337-59;Structure. 2008 May;16(5):766-75;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):821-9;Virology. 2007 Jun 5;362(2):384-96;Nucleic Acids Res. 1994 Mar 11;22(5):773-9;Methods Mol Biol. 2009;502:239-51;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):400-10;J Bacteriol. 2011 Oct;193(19):5573;Nature. 2013 Jan 17;493(7432):429-32;J Mol Biol. 1992 Dec 5;228(3):870-84;J Bacteriol. 2009 Jan;191(1):210-9;Genes Dev. 1992 Mar;6(3):497-510;Theor Popul Biol. 2002 Jun;61(4):471-80;Bacteriophage. 2012 Oct 1;2(4):225-228;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2005 Aug;8(4):488-94;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;J Mol Biol. 2003 Jul 4;330(2):261-75;MBio. 2014;5(2):e00896;Genome Biol. 2003;4(9):R57;Mol Cell. 2009 May 15;34(3):375-86;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2003 Oct;6(5):506-11;J Clin Microbiol. 2011 Mar;49(3):993-1003;J Virol. 2012 Aug;86(15):8336;Nat Protoc. 2010 Apr;5(4):725-38;J Mol Biol. 2001 Nov 30;314(3):433-44;BMC Genomics. 2012;13:311;J Bacteriol. 2011 Dec;193(24):7010;Nat Commun. 2014;5:4520;J Mol Biol. 1977 Feb 5;109(4):487-514;Virology. 2004 Aug 15;326(1):41-6;J Biomol NMR. 2005 Apr;31(4):351-6;J Bacteriol. 2004 Oct;186(19):6560-74;PLoS One. 2010;5(6):e11147;Curr Protoc Bioinformatics. 2003 May;Chapter 4:Unit4.5;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jan;37(Database issue):D211-5;Mol Microbiol. 2008 Jul;69(2):303-16;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;PLoS Genet. 2013;9(9):e1003825;Virology. 2011 Dec 20;421(2):211-21;Genome Biol. 2004;5(2):R12;J Bacteriol. 2005 Mar;187(6):2050-7;Genetika. 2000 Dec;36(12):1645-55;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2008 Oct;11(5):472-7;Bioinformatics. 2001 Dec;17(12):1123-30;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2012 Jun;78(12):4510-5;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D225-9;Bioinformatics. 2005 Nov 15;21(22):4187-9;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Nov;12(11):3035-56;J Mol Biol. 2004 Jun 25;340(1):49-65;Comput Chem. 2001 Dec;26(1):51-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Bioinformatics. 2008 Dec 1;24(23):2672-6;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2005 Aug;8(4):466-72;J Mol Biol. 2009 Jun 26;389(5):938-51	MEDLINE	epublish

Microbiol.	1873-2542	Divergence of a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during an outbreak of ovine mastitis.	Bacterial infections causing mastitis in sheep can result in severe economic losses for farmers. A large survey of milk samples from ewes with mastitis in Sardinia, Italy, indicated an increasing prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. It has been shown previously that during chronic, biofilm-associated infections P. aeruginosa populations diversify. We report the phenotypic and genomic characterisation of two clonal P. aeruginosa isolates (PSE305 and PSE306) from a mastitis infection outbreak, representing distinct colony morphology variants. In addition to pigment production, PSE305 and PSE306 differed in phenotypic characteristics including biofilm formation, utilisation of various carbon and nitrogen sources, twitching motility. We found higher levels of expression of genes associated with biofilm formation (pelB) and twitching motility (flgD) in PSE305, compared to the biofilm and twitching-defective PSE306. Comparative genomics analysis revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and minor insertion/deletion variations between PSE305 and PSE306, including a SNP mutation in the pilP gene of PSE306. By introducing a wild-type pilP gene we were able to partially complement the defective twitching motility of PSE306. There were also three larger regions of difference between the two genomes, indicating genomic instability. Hence, we have demonstrated that P. aeruginosa population divergence can occur during an outbreak of mastitis, leading to significant variations in phenotype and genotype, and resembling the behaviour of P. aeruginosa during chronic biofilm-associated infections.	175	1	105-13	10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.11.011	Wright;Di Lorenzo;Trappetti;Liciardi;Orru;Viti;Bronowski;Hall;Darby;Oggioni;Winstanley	Elli A;Valeria;Claudia;Manuele;Germano;Carlo;Christina;Amanda J;Alistair C;Marco R;Craig	Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.;Laboratorio di Microbiologia Molecolare e Biotecnologia, Dipartimento di Biologia Molecolare, Università di Siena, Siena, Italy.;Laboratorio di Microbiologia Molecolare e Biotecnologia, Dipartimento di Biologia Molecolare, Università di Siena, Siena, Italy.;Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Sardegna, Italy.;Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Servizio Sequenziamento DNA, Policlinico, Università di Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.;Dip. di Biotecnologie Agrarie, Università di Firenze, Firenze, Italy.;Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.;Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.;Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.;Laboratorio di Microbiologia Molecolare e Biotecnologia, Dipartimento di Biologia Molecolare, Università di Siena, Siena, Italy; UOC Batteriologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy; Department of Genetics, University of Leicester, Leicester LES1 7RH, UK.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a notoriously difficult-to-treat pathogen that is a common cause of severe nosocomial infections. Investigating a collection of β-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from a decade ago, we uncovered resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam, a novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination. The isolates were systematically analyzed through a variety of genetic, biochemical, genomic, and microbiological methods to understand how resistance manifests to a unique drug combination that is not yet clinically released. We discovered that avibactam was able to inactivate different AmpC β-lactamase enzymes and that blaPDC regulatory elements and penicillin-binding protein differences did not contribute in a major way to resistance. By using carefully selected combinations of antimicrobial agents, we deduced that the greatest barrier to ceftazidime-avibactam is membrane permeability and drug efflux. To overcome the constellation of resistance determinants, we show that a combination of antimicrobial agents (ceftazidime/avibactam/fosfomycin) targeting multiple cell wall synthetic pathways can restore susceptibility. In P. aeruginosa, efflux, as a general mechanism of resistance, may pose the greatest challenge to future antibiotic development. Our unexpected findings create concern that even the development of antimicrobial agents targeted for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria may encounter clinically important resistance. Antibiotic therapy in the future must consider these factors.	59	2	1020-9	10.1128/AAC.04238-14	Winkler;Papp-Wallace;Hujer;Domitrovic;Hujer;Hurless;Tuohy;Hall;Bonomo	Marisa L;Krisztina M;Andrea M;T Nicholas;Kristine M;Kelly N;Marion;Geraldine;Robert A	Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA Research Service, Louis Stokes Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;Research Service, Louis Stokes Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;Research Service, Louis Stokes Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;Research Service, Louis Stokes Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;Research Service, Louis Stokes Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;Research Service, Louis Stokes Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;Department of Clinical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;Department of Clinical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.;Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA Research Service, Louis Stokes Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA robert.bonomo@va.gov.	eng	Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 Jun;55(6):2992-4;Curr Med Chem. 2001 Dec;8(14):1699-711;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Dec;56(12):6137-46;Microb Drug Resist. 2014 Jun;20(3):231-7;Chem Biol. 2011 Jan 28;18(1):38-47;Bioorg Chem. 2014 Oct;56:41-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 May;55(5):2434-7;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010 Nov;65(11):2376-81;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Dec;54(12):5132-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Jul 17;109(29):11663-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014 Oct;58(10):5704-13;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009 Oct;22(4):582-610;Bioinformatics. 2006 Jan 15;22(2):195-201;Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2013 Oct;32(10):1291-4;Molecules. 2012;17(11):12478-505;MBio. 2012;3(5). pii: e00312-12. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00312-12;Chemotherapy. 2007;53(3):202-9;Genet Mol Res. 2003;2(1):48-62;Trends Microbiol. 2009 Mar;17(3):130-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014;58(3):1365-71;J Infect Dis. 1986 Aug;154(2):289-94;Protein Sci. 2011 Jun;20(6):941-58;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2000 Mar;44(3):561-7;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 Mar;55(3):1211-21;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014 Nov;58(11):6844-50;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 May;53(5):1766-71;Nat Protoc. 2009;4(1):1-13;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Mar;56(3):1606-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jul;42(Web Server issue):W252-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Jan;56(1):231-42;Infect Genet Evol. 2014 Jun;24:187-92;Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2013 Jan;1277:54-75;Core Evid. 2014 Jan 24;9:13-25;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Nov 25;100(24):14339-44;J Med Chem. 2013 Feb 14;56(3):1084-97;Curr Microbiol. 2009 Sep;59(3):352-5;Front Microbiol. 2014 Jan 08;4:422;Clin Infect Dis. 1998 Aug;27 Suppl 1:S93-9;J Bacteriol. 1996 Oct;178(20):5853-9;Clin Infect Dis. 2013 Jun;56(12):1685-94;J Bacteriol. 1997 Mar;179(5):1490-6;Intern Emerg Med. 2012 Oct;7 Suppl 3:S271-81;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2002 Nov;46(11):3406-11;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Apr;56(4):1703-13;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014;58(3):1684-92;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2014 Aug;58(8):4290-7;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2010 Jan;23(1):160-201;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010 Jul;65(7):1540-2;J Bacteriol. 1993 Dec;175(24):7793-800;Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1974 May 10;235(0):364-86;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Jan;45(1):105-16;J Infect Chemother. 2002 Mar;8(1):37-42;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2002;56:17-38;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Jun;57(6):2496-505;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2007 Mar;5(3):175-86;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Mar;56(3):1529-38;J Cyst Fibros. 2003 Mar;2(1):19-24;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Jun;57(6):2788-92;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 Nov;55(11):4943-60;Electrophoresis. 2009 Jun;30 Suppl 1:S162-73;J Biol Chem. 2013 Sep 27;288(39):27960-71	MEDLINE	ppublish

Genet.	1546-1718	Convergent evolution and adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa within patients with cystic fibrosis.	Little is known about how within-host evolution compares between genotypically different strains of the same pathogenic species. We sequenced the whole genomes of 474 longitudinally collected clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sampled from 34 children and young individuals with cystic fibrosis. Our analysis of 36 P. aeruginosa lineages identified convergent molecular evolution in 52 genes. This list of genes suggests a role in host adaptation for remodeling of regulatory networks and central metabolism, acquisition of antibiotic resistance and loss of extracellular virulence factors. Furthermore, we find an ordered succession of mutations in key regulatory networks. Accordingly, mutations in downstream transcriptional regulators were contingent upon mutations in upstream regulators, suggesting that remodeling of regulatory networks might be important in adaptation. The characterization of genes involved in host adaptation may help in predicting bacterial evolution in patients with cystic fibrosis and in the design of future intervention strategies.	47	1	57-64	10.1038/ng.3148	Marvig;Sommer;Molin;Johansen	Rasmus Lykke;Lea Mette;Søren;Helle Krogh	1] Department of Clinical Microbiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Immun.	1098-5522	Contribution of Veillonella parvula to Pseudomonas aeruginosa-mediated pathogenicity in a murine tumor model system.	The recent finding that high numbers of strict anaerobes are present in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has drawn attention to the pathogenic contribution of the CF microbiome to airway disease. In this study, we investigated the specific interactions of the most dominant bacterial CF pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with the anaerobic bacterium Veillonella parvula, which has been recovered at comparable cell numbers from the respiratory tract of CF patients. In addition to growth competition experiments, transcriptional profiling, and analyses of biofilm formation by in vitro studies, we used our recently established in vivo murine tumor model to investigate mutual influences of the two pathogens during a biofilm-associated infection process. We found that P. aeruginosa and V. parvula colonized distinct niches within the tumor. Interestingly, significantly higher cell numbers of P. aeruginosa could be recovered from the tumor tissue when mice were coinfected with both bacterial species than when mice were monoinfected with P. aeruginosa. Concordantly, the results of in vivo transcriptional profiling implied that the presence of V. parvula supports P. aeruginosa growth at the site of infection in the host, and the higher P. aeruginosa load correlated with clinical deterioration of the host. Although many challenges must be overcome to dissect the specific interactions of coinfecting bacteria during an infection process, our findings exemplarily demonstrate that the complex interrelations between coinfecting microorganisms and the immune responses determine clinical outcome to a much greater extent than previously anticipated.	83	1	417-29	10.1128/IAI.02234-14	Pustelny;Komor;Pawar;Lorenz;Bielecka;Moter;Gocht;Eckweiler;Müsken;Grothe;Lünsdorf;Weiss;Häussler	Christian;Uliana;Vinay;Anne;Agata;Annette;Benjamin;Denitsa;Mathias;Claudia;Heinrich;Siegfried;Susanne	Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Hannover, Germany.;Molecular Immunology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.;Molecular Immunology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Hannover, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Hannover, Germany.;Biofilmcenter, German Heart Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany.;Biofilmcenter, German Heart Institute Berlin, Berlin, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Hannover, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Hannover, Germany.;Institute of Neuroanatomy, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.;Department of Vaccinology and Applied Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.;Molecular Immunology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.;Department of Molecular Bacteriology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany Institute of Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE GmbH, Hannover, Germany susanne.haeussler@helmholtz-hzi.de.	eng	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8;J Infect. 2005 Jan;50(1):81-3;J Clin Microbiol. 2006 Jul;44(7):2655-6;J Clin Microbiol. 2007 Feb;45(2):672-4;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2007 Jun;271(1):90-7;J Dent Res. 2008 Mar;87(3):278-82;Oral Microbiol Immunol. 2008 Jun;23(3):183-9;Cancer Res. 2008 Apr 15;68(8):2952-60;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2008 May 1;177(9):995-1001;Int J Infect Dis. 2008 Nov;12(6):e115-7;Cell Microbiol. 2009 Feb;11(2):208-16;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2009 May;15(5):454-60;J Clin Microbiol. 2010 Jan;48(1):78-86;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2010 Jun;16(6):767-73;J Mol Med (Berl). 2010 Aug;88(8):763-73;Nat Protoc. 2010 Aug;5(8):1460-9;J Bacteriol. 2010 Oct;192(19):5002-17;Thorax. 2010 Nov;65(11):978-84;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Mar 8;108(10):4152-7;Genome Res. 2011 Jun;21(6):936-9;Clin Infect Dis. 2000 Sep;31(3):839-40;Methods Enzymol. 2001;336:317-31;Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2001 May;20(5):340-2;J Microbiol Immunol Infect. 2001 Dec;34(4):287-92;J Clin Invest. 2002 Feb;109(3):317-25;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2002 Apr;15(2):194-222;Microbiology. 2003 May;149(Pt 5):1095-102;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Dec;50(5):1477-91;Med Hypotheses. 2004;63(4):659-61;J Ultrastruct Res. 1969 Jan;26(1):31-43;J Clin Microbiol. 1987 Aug;25(8):1579-80;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1988 Aug;54(8):1957-63;Clin Infect Dis. 1992 Jan;14(1):361-3;Cytometry. 1993;14(2):136-43;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1993 Oct;59(10):3219-24;J Clin Microbiol. 1996 May;34(5):1283-5;J Clin Microbiol. 1996 Dec;34(12):3235-6;Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 1998 Jan;17(1):62-4;Microbiology. 1998 Sep;144 ( Pt 9):2459-67;Microbiology. 2005 Apr;151(Pt 4):1113-25;BMC Ecol. 2006;6:1;Thorax. 2011 Jul;66(7):579-84;Thorax. 2011 Jul;66(7):558-9;Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2011;49(2):263-6;PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31092;Thorax. 2012 May;67(5):456-63;Microbes Infect. 2012 Sep;14(11):951-8;Future Microbiol. 2012 Dec;7(12):1423-9;Environ Microbiol. 2013 Feb;15(2):570-87;PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e62917;J Intern Med. 2014 Aug;276(2):130-9;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Nov;42(11):5176-83;J Clin Microbiol. 2006 Jul;44(7):2601-4	MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas putida is a member of the fluorescent pseudomonads known to produce the yellow-green fluorescent pyoverdine siderophore. P. putida W15Oct28, isolated from a stream in Brussels, was found to produce compound(s) with antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, an unusual characteristic for P. putida. The active compound production only occurred in media with low iron content and without organic nitrogen sources. Transposon mutants which lost their antimicrobial activity had the majority of insertions in genes involved in the biosynthesis of pyoverdine, although purified pyoverdine was not responsible for the antagonism. Separation of compounds present in culture supernatants revealed the presence of two fractions containing highly hydrophobic molecules active against P. aeruginosa. Analysis of the draft genome confirmed the presence of putisolvin biosynthesis genes and the corresponding lipopeptides were found to contribute to the antimicrobial activity. One cluster of ten genes was detected, comprising a NAD-dependent epimerase, an acetylornithine aminotransferase, an acyl CoA dehydrogenase, a short chain dehydrogenase, a fatty acid desaturase and three genes for a RND efflux pump. P. putida W15Oct28 genome also contains 56 genes encoding TonB-dependent receptors, conferring a high capacity to utilize pyoverdines from other pseudomonads. One unique feature of W15Oct28 is also the presence of different secretion systems including a full set of genes for type IV secretion, and several genes for type VI secretion and their VgrG effectors.	9	11	e110038	10.1371/journal.pone.0110038	Ye;Hildebrand;Dingemans;Ballet;Laus;Matthijs;Berendsen;Cornelis	Lumeng;Falk;Jozef;Steven;George;Sandra;Roeland;Pierre	Department of Bioengineering Sciences, Research group Microbiology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel and VIB Structural Biology Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.;Department of Bioengineering Sciences, Research group Microbiology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel and VIB Structural Biology Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.;Department of Bioengineering Sciences, Research group Microbiology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel and VIB Structural Biology Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.;Chemistry Department, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2, 1050 Brussels, Belgium.;Chemistry Department, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2, 1050 Brussels, Belgium.;Institut de Recherches Microbiologiques - Wiame, Campus du CERIA, Brussels, Belgium.;Plant-Microbe Interactions, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.;Department of Bioengineering Sciences, Research group Microbiology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel and VIB Structural Biology Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.	eng	Chem Biol. 2003 May;10(5):419-30;PLoS Genet. 2012 Jul;8(7):e1002784;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):799-808;J Bacteriol. 2006 Apr;188(8):2898-906;Infect Immun. 2002 Mar;70(3):1657-63;Genome Announc. 2014 Feb 13;2(1):null;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jul;39(Web Server issue):W339-46;J Bacteriol. 1998 Jul;180(13):3323-9;Org Lett. 2003 Jun 12;5(12):2095-8;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:75;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Oct;46(2):505-17;Nat Prod Rep. 2009 Nov;26(11):1408-46;Environ Microbiol Rep. 2010 Jun;2(3):381-8;J Bacteriol. 2001 Jul;183(13):3967-73;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2010 May;86(6):1637-45;PLoS One. 2013;8(5):e62946;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):821-9;PLoS Biol. 2014 Aug;12(8):e1001920;Bioinformatics. 2009 Mar 1;25(5):664-5;Environ Microbiol. 2013 Jun;15(6):1661-73;Trends Microbiol. 2003 May;11(5):195-200;Environ Microbiol. 2013 Mar;15(3):780-94;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Sep;45(6):1673-85;Biometals. 2014 Aug;27(4):633-44;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jun;12(6):1513-30;Biochem Soc Trans. 2012 Dec 1;40(6):1433-7;Plasmid. 2009 Sep;62(2):88-97;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2006 Oct;263(2):169-75;PLoS One. 2013;8(10):e79111;Microbiology. 2002 Feb;148(Pt 2):341-3;Chem Biol. 1999 Aug;6(8):493-505;Trends Microbiol. 2002 Mar;10(3):107-12;Environ Microbiol. 2005 Jul;7(7):969-80;Protein Cell. 2010 Dec;1(12):1093-105;Environ Microbiol Rep. 2013 Feb;5(1):160-9;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1998 Jul;64(7):2710-5;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Apr;56(1):144-54;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Jul;35(Web Server issue):W52-7;J Bacteriol. 2012 Aug;194(15):4121;Amino Acids. 2013 May;44(5):1267-77;Org Biomol Chem. 2011 Sep 21;9(18):6219-25;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2007 Mar;71(1):158-229;J Bacteriol. 2013 Feb;195(4):765-76;Biometals. 2013 Aug;26(4):561-75;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2004 Sep;70(9):5190-8;Biochimie. 2002 May-Jun;84(5-6):499-510;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Nov 10;106(45):19126-31;Res Microbiol. 2013 May;164(4):351-9;J Bacteriol. 2011 Feb;193(4):918-31;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jul 1;36(Web Server issue):W181-4;Biometals. 2009 Dec;22(6):951-64;Genome Announc. 2013 Jul 18;1(4):null;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 May;74(10):3085-93;Microbiology. 2008 Jul;154(Pt 7):2070-83;Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jul;41(Web Server issue):W204-12;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jun;12(6):1377-83;Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):1982-94;Trends Microbiol. 2007 Jan;15(1):22-30;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Jan;51(1):97-113	MEDLINE	epublish

Agents Chemother.	1098-6596	The resistome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in relationship to phenotypic susceptibility.	Many clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cause infections that are difficult to eradicate due to their resistance to a wide variety of antibiotics. Key genetic determinants of resistance were identified through genome sequences of 390 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, obtained from diverse geographic locations collected between 2003 and 2012 and were related to microbiological susceptibility data for meropenem, levofloxacin, and amikacin. β-Lactamases and integron cassette arrangements were enriched in the established multidrug-resistant lineages of sequence types ST111 (predominantly O12) and ST235 (O11). This study demonstrates the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in defining relevant resistance elements and highlights the diversity of resistance determinants within P. aeruginosa. This information is valuable in furthering the design of diagnostics and therapeutics for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections.	59	1	427-36	10.1128/AAC.03954-14	Kos;Déraspe;McLaughlin;Whiteaker;Roy;Alm;Corbeil;Gardner	Veronica N;Maxime;Robert E;James D;Paul H;Richard A;Jacques;Humphrey	Infection Innovative Medicines Unit, AstraZeneca R&D Boston, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA veronica.kos@astrazeneca.com.;Infectious Diseases Research Center, Laval University, Quebec, Quebec, Canada.;Infection Innovative Medicines Unit, AstraZeneca R&D Boston, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.;Infection Innovative Medicines Unit, AstraZeneca R&D Boston, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.;Infectious Diseases Research Center, Laval University, Quebec, Quebec, Canada.;Infection Innovative Medicines Unit, AstraZeneca R&D Boston, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.;Infectious Diseases Research Center, Laval University, Quebec, Quebec, Canada.;Infection Innovative Medicines Unit, AstraZeneca R&D Boston, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.	eng	Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Jul;45(7):1994-2000;Nucleic Acids Res. 1987 Sep 25;15(18):7491-501;Bioinformatics. 2006 Nov 1;22(21):2688-90;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2005 Jul;56(1):20-51;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2014 Apr;43(4):328-34;Braz J Infect Dis. 2013 May-Jun;17(3):346-52;JAMA Intern Med. 2013 Aug 12;173(15):1397-404;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1999 Jan;43(1):62-6;Trends Microbiol. 2011 Aug;19(8):419-26;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1987 Dec;31(12):1892-6;Front Microbiol. 2011 Apr 05;2:65;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Apr;85(8):2444-8;J Med Microbiol. 2009 Sep;58(Pt 9):1133-48;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009 Oct;22(4):582-610;BMC Bioinformatics. 2010;11:595;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1993 Nov;37(11):2385-90;Mol Biol Evol. 2013 Apr;30(4):772-80;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2011 Sep;35(5):736-55;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 Dec;55(12):5761-9;Nat Med. 2006 Jan;12(1):83-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Apr 15;111(15):5694-9;PLoS One. 2011;6(7):e22751;Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2011 Dec;30(6):545-8;Clin Infect Dis. 2007 Jan 15;44(2):159-77;Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2005 Aug;18(4):306-13;J Bacteriol. 1999 Sep;181(17):5426-32;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Apr 1;111(13):4988-93;MBio. 2010;1(4). pii: e00227-10. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00227-10;PLoS One. 2014;9(2):e87611;Nature. 2013 Jan 17;493(7432):429-32;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2014 May;69(5):1248-56;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 Mar;55(3):1211-21;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2013 Oct;68(10):2234-44;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Dec;42(12):5644-9;J Bacteriol. 2009 Oct;191(19):6040-51;Infect Immun. 2011 Dec;79(12):4802-18;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Jan;57(1):458-65;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Nov;49(11):4567-75;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2001 Mar;47(3):247-50;Infect Genet Evol. 2014 Jun;24:187-92;J Bacteriol. 2012 Nov;194(21):5728-38;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1990 Jun;34(6):1273-5;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Jul;57(7):3137-46;Methods Enzymol. 1996;266:227-58;MBio. 2014;5(2):e00896;PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e49300;Sci Transl Med. 2012 Aug 22;4(148):148ra116;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Aug;54(8):3372-82;N Engl J Med. 2011 Aug 25;365(8):709-17;Emerg Infect Dis. 2012 Aug;18(8):1235-41;Clin Infect Dis. 2005 Jul 15;41 Suppl 2:S120-6;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2014 Jul;69(7):1729-33;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Nov;84(21):7378-82;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2014 Oct;20(10):O609-18;Science. 2010 Jan 8;327(5962):167-70;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Mar;57(3):1361-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2003 Oct;47(10):3202-7;PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25617;Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):2200-11;BMC Infect Dis. 2012;12:176;Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2013 Jan;1277:1-7;J Comput Biol. 2010 Nov;17(11):1519-33;Euro Surveill. 2008 Nov 20;13(47). pii: 19045;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007 Mar;51(3):852-6;J Infect Chemother. 2002 Dec;8(4):371-3;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2003 Jan;47(1):27-33;N Engl J Med. 2012 Jun 14;366(24):2267-75;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2002 Apr;15(2):194-222;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2013 Apr;68(4):771-7;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2002;56:17-38;Lancet Infect Dis. 2013 Feb;13(2):130-6;PLoS One. 2010;5(1):e8842;Nat Rev Genet. 2010 Mar;11(3):181-90;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2013 Dec;68(12):2710-7;Clin Infect Dis. 2013 Jun;56(11):1614-20;J Clin Microbiol. 2011 Oct;49(10):3714-6;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Nov;53(11):4783-8;BMC Microbiol. 2012;12:152;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Microb Drug Resist. 2011 Jun;17(2):215-20	MEDLINE	ppublish

The advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques has made it possible to follow the genomic evolution of pathogenic bacteria by comparing longitudinally collected bacteria sampled from human hosts. Such studies in the context of chronic airway infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have indicated high bacterial population diversity. Such diversity may be driven by hypermutability resulting from DNA mismatch repair system (MRS) deficiency, a common trait evolved by P. aeruginosa strains in CF infections. No studies to date have utilized whole-genome sequencing to investigate within-host population diversity or long-term evolution of mutators in CF airways. We sequenced the genomes of 13 and 14 isolates of P. aeruginosa mutator populations from an Argentinian and a Danish CF patient, respectively. Our collection of isolates spanned 6 and 20 years of patient infection history, respectively. We sequenced 11 isolates from a single sample from each patient to allow in-depth analysis of population diversity. Each patient was infected by clonal populations of bacteria that were dominated by mutators. The in vivo mutation rate of the populations was ∼100 SNPs/year-∼40-fold higher than rates in normo-mutable populations. Comparison of the genomes of 11 isolates from the same sample showed extensive within-patient genomic diversification; the populations were composed of different sub-lineages that had coexisted for many years since the initial colonization of the patient. Analysis of the mutations identified genes that underwent convergent evolution across lineages and sub-lineages, suggesting that the genes were targeted by mutation to optimize pathogenic fitness. Parallel evolution was observed in reduction of overall catabolic capacity of the populations. These findings are useful for understanding the evolution of pathogen populations and identifying new targets for control of chronic infections.	10	10	e1004651	10.1371/journal.pgen.1004651	Feliziani;Marvig;Luján;Moyano;Di Rienzo;Krogh Johansen;Molin;Smania	Sofía;Rasmus L;Adela M;Alejandro J;Julio A;Helle;Søren;Andrea M	Centro de Investigaciones en Química Biológica de Córdoba (CIQUIBIC), CONICET, Departamento de Química Biológica, Facultad de Ciencias Químicas, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Córdoba, Argentina.;Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.;Centro de Investigaciones en Química Biológica de Córdoba (CIQUIBIC), CONICET, Departamento de Química Biológica, Facultad de Ciencias Químicas, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Córdoba, Argentina;

174	25329302	2014				Electronic-eCollection	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	PloS one	PLoS ONE	1932-6203	Genome analysis of environmental and clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from sequence type-1146.	The genomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates of the new sequence type ST-1146, three environmental (P37, P47 and P49) and one clinical (SD9) isolates, with differences in their antibiotic susceptibility profiles have been sequenced and analysed. The genomes were mapped against P. aeruginosa PAO1-UW and UCBPP-PA14. The allelic profiles showed that the highest number of differences were in Related to phage, transposon or plasmid and Secreted factors categories. The clinical isolate showed a number of exclusive alleles greater than that for the environmental isolates. The phage Pf1 region in isolate SD9 accumulated the highest number of nucleotide substitutions. The ORF analysis of the four genomes assembled de novo indicated that the number of isolate-specific genes was higher in isolate SD9 (132 genes) than in isolates P37 (24 genes), P47 (16 genes) and P49 (21 genes). CRISPR elements were found in all isolates and SD9 showed differences in the spacer region. Genes related to bacteriophages F116 and H66 were found only in isolate SD9. Genome comparisons indicated that the isolates of ST-1146 are close related, and most genes implicated in pathogenicity are highly conserved, suggesting a genetic potential for infectivity in the environmental isolates similar to the clinical one. Phage-related genes are responsible of the main differences among the genomes of ST-1146 isolates. The role of bacteriophages has to be considered in the adaptation processes of isolates to the host and in microevolution studies.	9	10	e107754	10.1371/journal.pone.0107754	Sánchez;Gomila;Bennasar;Lalucat;García-Valdés	David;Margarita;Antonio;Jorge;Elena	Microbiologia, Departament de Biologia, Edifici Guillem Colom, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Campus UIB, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Microbiologia, Departament de Biologia, Edifici Guillem Colom, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Campus UIB, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Microbiologia, Departament de Biologia, Edifici Guillem Colom, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Campus UIB, Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Instituto Universitario de Investigación en Ciencias de la Salud (IUNICS-UIB) Universitat de les Illes Balears, Campus UIB, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Microbiologia, Departament de Biologia, Edifici Guillem Colom, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Campus UIB, Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Institut Mediterrani d'Estudis Avançats (IMEDEA, CSIC-UIB), Campus UIB, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Microbiologia, Departament de Biologia, Edifici Guillem Colom, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Campus UIB, Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Institut Mediterrani d'Estudis Avançats (IMEDEA, CSIC-UIB), Campus UIB, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.	eng	Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):1952-67;J Bacteriol. 1996 Jan;178(1):85-93;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;Science. 2014 Apr 25;344(6182):416-20;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 8;104(19):8101-6;Bioinformatics. 2012 Apr 15;28(8):1166-7;J Bacteriol. 2004 Dec;186(23):8066-73;BMC Genomics. 2013 Jun 22;14:416;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;J Bacteriol. 2010 Feb;192(4):1113-21;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Environ Microbiol. 2003 Dec;5(12):1294-308;Curr Microbiol. 2013 Oct;67(4):423-30;Bioinformatics. 2006 Jul 1;22(13):1658-9;J Mol Evol. 2006 Jun;62(6):718-29;Environ Microbiol. 2013 Feb;15(2):325-33;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2010 Dec;74(4):621-41;J Mol Biol. 1997 Aug 22;271(3):386-404;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jul 1;36(Web Server issue):W145-8;BMC Microbiol. 2013 Jun 18;13:138;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Dec;42(12):5644-9;Environ Microbiol. 2003 Dec;5(12):1341-9;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;J Bacteriol. 2003 Feb;185(4):1316-25;PLoS One. 2010 Jun 25;5(6):e11147;PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e44199;Environ Microbiol. 2011 Jun;13(6):1590-600;Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2006;44:417-45;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Apr;56(4):1703-13;PLoS One. 2009 Nov 13;4(11):e7740;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Jul;35(Web Server issue):W52-7;Bioinformatics. 2009 Jun 1;25(11):1451-2;PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25617;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 8;100(14):8484-9;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Sep;53(5):1279-90;PLoS Pathog. 2012;8(7):e1002813;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 Oct;74(20):6194-205;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2011 Jun;9(6):467-77;Environ Microbiol. 2011 Jul;13(7):1690-704;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2012 Mar;18(3):268-81;Syst Appl Microbiol. 2012 Oct;35(7):455-64;PLoS One. 2011;6(12):e29113;BMC Genomics. 2014 Apr 28;15:318;Front Microbiol. 2011 Jul 13;2:150;Microb Ecol. 2012 Feb;63(2):239-48;Pathog Dis. 2014 Jun;71(1):20-5;Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Jul;38(Web Server issue):W647-51;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Jan;47(1):145-58;Bioinformatics. 2005 Apr 1;21(7):1280-1;Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Jul;38(12):e132;PLoS Comput Biol. 2005 Nov;1(6):e60;BMC Bioinformatics. 2007 May 23;8:172	MEDLINE	epublish

Whole-genome sequencing is an important method to understand the genetic information, gene function, biological characteristics and survival mechanisms of organisms. Sequencing large genomes is very simple at present. However, we encountered a hard-to-sequence genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage PaP1. Shotgun sequencing method failed to complete the sequence of this genome.;After persevering for 10 years and going over three generations of sequencing techniques, we successfully completed the sequence of the PaP1 genome with a length of 91,715 bp. Single-molecule real-time sequencing results revealed that this genome contains 51 N-6-methyladenines and 152 N-4-methylcytosines. Three significant modified sequence motifs were predicted, but not all of the sites found in the genome were methylated in these motifs. Further investigations revealed a novel immune mechanism of bacteria, in which host bacteria can recognise and repel modified bases containing inserts in a large scale. This mechanism could be accounted for the failure of the shotgun method in PaP1 genome sequencing. This problem was resolved using the nfi- mutant of Escherichia coli DH5α as a host bacterium to construct a shotgun library.;This work provided insights into the hard-to-sequence phage PaP1 genome and discovered a new mechanism of bacterial immunity. The methylome of phage PaP1 is responsible for the failure of shotgun sequencing and for bacterial immunity mediated by enzyme Endo V activity; this methylome also provides a valuable resource for future studies on PaP1 genome replication and modification, as well as on gene regulation and host interaction.	15		803	10.1186/1471-2164-15-803	Lu;Le;Tan;Li;Liu;Zhang;Huang;Chen;Rao;Zhu;Zou;Ni;Li;Wang;Jin;Hu;Yao;Zhao;Zhang;Huang;Hu	Shuguang;Shuai;Yinling;Ming;Chang;Kebin;Jianjun;Haimei;Xiancai;Junmin;Lingyun;Qingshan;Shu;Jing;Xiaolin;Qiwen;Xinyue;Xia;Lin;Guangtao;Fuquan	Department of Microbiology, College of Basic Medical Science, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, P, R, China. hufuquan2009@aliyun.com.	eng	Mol Biol Evol. 2011 Oct;28(10):2731-9;Nat Protoc. 2011 Sep;6(9):1367-76;J Bacteriol. 2012 Jan;194(1):49-60;Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Feb;40(4):e29;Genome Res. 2012 Apr;22(4):802-9;Nat Commun. 2012;3:945;PLoS One. 2012;7(7):e41967;Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Dec;40(22):11450-62;Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jan;41(Database issue):D991-5;PLoS Genet. 2013;9(1):e1003191;Structure. 2013 Feb 5;21(2):257-65;BMC Bioinformatics. 2012;13:238;J Virol. 2013 Mar;87(6):3237-47;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2013 Apr;16(2):192-8;PLoS One. 2013;8(5):e62933;PLoS One. 2013;8(7):e68562;BMC Genomics. 2013;14:675;Virol J. 2014;11:14;Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Feb;42(4):2415-32;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Jun 6;97(12):6640-5;Mutat Res. 2000 Nov 9;461(3):169-77;Mutat Res. 2001 Jan 5;461(4):301-9;Biochemistry. 2001 Jul 31;40(30):8738-48;Science. 2003 Jan 31;299(5607):682-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jul 1;31(13):3497-500;Biochemistry. 1973 Jan 2;12(1):151-7;Nature. 1976 Apr 8;260(5551):500-7;J Biol Chem. 1977 Mar 10;252(5):1647-53;Nature. 1977 Feb 24;265(5596):687-95;Mol Gen Genet. 1978 Nov 16;167(1):105-12;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1980;34:137-58;Biochemistry. 1981 Jun 9;20(12):3586-91;Photochem Photobiol. 1983 May;37(5):513-9;Microbiol Rev. 1993 Jun;57(2):434-50;Gene. 1995 May 26;158(1):9-14;Science. 1995 Jul 28;269(5223):496-512;FASEB J. 1995 Aug;9(11):1034-42;Biotechniques. 1997 Jul;23(1):98-100;J Biol Chem. 1960 Nov;235:3254-9;J Mol Biol. 1962 Aug;5:248-50;Nature. 1963 Feb 23;197:794-5;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W686-9;J Bacteriol. 2006 Apr;188(7):2568-77;Cell Microbiol. 2007 Feb;9(2):479-91;Methods Enzymol. 2007;421:259-68;Genome Res. 2008 Feb;18(2):324-30;Curr Protoc Bioinformatics. 2007 Mar;Chapter 11:Unit11.4;Nat Biotechnol. 2008 Oct;26(10):1135-45;Trends Biotechnol. 2008 Nov;26(11):602-11;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jan;37(1):e1;J Mol Model. 2009 Feb;15(2):173-82;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Jan 20;106(3):894-9;Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2009 Feb;16(2):138-43;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jul;37(Web Server issue):W202-8;Mol Phylogenet Evol. 2009 Sep;52(3):846-51;Nat Methods. 2010 Jun;7(6):461-5;BMC Genomics. 2010;11:362;Chem Biol. 2010 Jul 30;17(7):675-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Aug;38(15):e159;BMC Genomics. 2011;12:168;Mol Microbiol. 2011 Nov;82(3):567-77	MEDLINE	epublish

RNA sequencing technologies reveal that bacteria express RNA molecules other than mRNA, rRNA or tRNA. During the last years genome-wide bacterial transcriptomes have been shown to comprise intergenic RNA, antisense RNA, and untranslated regions, all capable of performing diverse regulatory functions.;In this study we used RNA-seq to identify 232 antisense RNAs (asRNAs) in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown under 13 different conditions. The conditions studied include exponential and stationary growth as well as osmotic, oxidative and antibiotic stress. We found a significant overrepresentation of asRNAs that are transcribed opposite to genes involved in cell division and in cell wall, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and capsule biosynthesis, most likely reflecting the conditions used in this study. A substantial number of asRNAs significantly changed their expression under osmotic, oxidative and antibiotic stress, suggesting that asRNAs may play regulatory roles during these conditions. We also made a comparison between the asRNAs detected in this study in P. aeruginosa PAO1 with the asRNAs detected in two previous studies in P. aeruginosa PA14, and found that the extent of overlap between the studies is very limited.;RNA-seq experiments are revealing hundreds of novel transcripts in all bacterial genomes investigated. The comparison between independent studies that used RNA-seq to detect novel asRNAs in P. aeruginosa shows that the overlap between the results reported is very narrow. It is necessary to address how reproducibility of these kind of studies should be reported in order to avoid misleading conclusions when comparing data generated by non-identical methods.	15		783	10.1186/1471-2164-15-783	Gómez-Lozano;Marvig;Tulstrup;Molin	María;Rasmus L;Monica V L;Søren	Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark. sm@bio.dtu.dk.	eng	Science. 2009 Nov 27;326(5957):1268-71;J Bacteriol. 2010 May;192(9):2359-72;EMBO J. 2010 Sep 15;29(18):3094-107;Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2011 Dec;3(12). pii: a003798. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a003798;Pediatr Res. 1994 Oct;36(4):487-93;Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Jan;38(3):868-77;PLoS Pathog. 2012 Sep;8(9):e1002945;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Sep;73(6):1043-57;Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2012 Jan;19(1):105-12;Pediatr Pulmonol. 1996 Mar;21(3):153-8;RNA. 2010 Dec;16(12):2537-52;Nature. 2009 Jun 18;459(7249):950-6;Am Rev Respir Dis. 1963 Aug;88:199-204;Anal Biochem. 2011 Dec 15;419(2):317-22;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1984 Feb;25(2):279-80;Bioinformatics. 2009 Aug 15;25(16):2078-9;PLoS Genet. 2008 Jun;4(6):e1000094;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Mar;78(3):1421-5;Acta Paediatr Scand. 1983 Sep;72(5):651-7;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Dec 13;108(50):20172-7;MBio. 2010 May 18;1(1):null;J Bacteriol. 2006 Oct;188(20):7101-10;RNA. 2011 Sep;17(9):1697-712;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Oct;74(1):139-58;Biochemistry. 2009 Jun 16;48(23):5446-55;Thorax. 1997 Jun;52(6):557-60;Nat Methods. 2009 Jul;6(7):474-6;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Aug;73(3):397-408;Nature. 2010 Mar 11;464(7286):250-5;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Nov;39(21):e141;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2007 Apr;10(2):102-9;Annu Rev Genet. 2010;44:167-88;Biotechniques. 2012 Feb;52(2):87-94;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007;35(3):962-74;Eur Respir J. 2000 Oct;16(4):749-67;Mol Microbiol. 2010 Jun;76(6):1427-43;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Oct;78(10):6008-12;Nat Methods. 2012 Apr;9(4):357-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Apr;40(7):e54;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 1999 Sep;63(3):523-53;BMC Med. 2011;9:32;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 1995 Apr;151(4):939-41;JAMA. 2003 Oct 1;290(13):1749-56;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Nov 22;102(47):17136-41;Biochem J. 1998 Jun 15;332 (Pt 3):807-8;J Bacteriol. 2010 Jul;192(13):3249-58;Pediatrics. 1959 Nov;24:739-45;Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):2006-16;PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36553;EMBO J. 1983;2(1):93-8;Nat Methods. 2010 Sep;7(9):687-92	MEDLINE	epublish

The fitness of sensitive and resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in different aquatic environments depends on genetic capacities and transcriptional regulation. Therefore, an antibiotic-sensitive isolate PA30 and a multi-resistant isolate PA49 originating from waste waters were compared via whole genome and transcriptome Illumina sequencing after exposure to municipal waste water and tap water. A number of different genomic islands (e.g. PAGIs, PAPIs) were identified in the two environmental isolates beside the highly conserved core genome. Exposure to tap water and waste water exhibited similar transcriptional impacts on several gene clusters (antibiotic and metal resistance, genetic mobile elements, efflux pumps) in both environmental P. aeruginosa isolates. The MexCD-OprJ efflux pump was overexpressed in PA49 in response to waste water. The expression of resistance genes, genetic mobile elements in PA49 was independent from the water matrix. Consistently, the antibiotic sensitive strain PA30 did not show any difference in expression of the intrinsic resistance determinants and genetic mobile elements. Thus, the exposure of both isolates to polluted waste water and oligotrophic tap water resulted in similar expression profiles of mentioned genes. However, changes in environmental milieus resulted in rather unspecific transcriptional responses than selected and stimuli-specific gene regulation.	8	1	116-30	10.1111/1751-7915.12156	Schwartz;Armant;Bretschneider;Hahn;Kirchen;Seifert;Dötsch	Thomas;Olivier;Nancy;Alexander;Silke;Martin;Andreas	Institute of Functional Interfaces (IFG), Campus North, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Hermann von Helmholtz Platz 1, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, D-76344, Germany.	eng	Biofouling. 2013 Sep;29(8):891-907;BMC Bioinformatics. 2012;13:183;PLoS One. 2008;3(2):e1619;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;Int J Lang Commun Disord. 2009 Sep-Oct;44(5):784-94;Trends Microbiol. 2011 Aug;19(8):419-26;BMC Bioinformatics. 2010;11:595;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2006 Oct;9(5):445-53;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2009 Jan;290(1):70-8;PLoS Genet. 2013;9(1):e1003144;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jun;36(10):3420-35;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;Genet Mol Res. 2003;2(1):48-62;PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27606;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006 May;50(5):1615-22;Am J Infect Control. 2005 Jun;33(5 Suppl 1):S41-9;Bioinformatics. 2012 Jun 1;28(11):1420-8;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2010 Dec;74(4):621-41;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Dec;42(12):5644-9;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2002 Apr;15(2):167-93;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;Sci Total Environ. 2013 Mar 1;447:345-60;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2004;58:161-81;Bioinformatics. 2005 Sep 15;21(18):3674-6;BMC Bioinformatics. 2009;10:421;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Jul;57(7):3348-57;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):872-82;Rev Infect Dis. 1984 Sep-Oct;6 Suppl 3:S627-42;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Mar;57(3):1361-8;Genome Biol. 2004;5(2):R12;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Dec 24;99(26):17025-30;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2009 Jan;33(1):44-65;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Jun;53(6):2522-31;J Bacteriol. 2007 Jun;189(11):4310-4;Mol Microbiol. 1996 Aug;21(4):713-24;Nat Methods. 2012 Apr;9(4):357-9;Comput Appl Biosci. 1996 Aug;12(4):357-8;BMC Genomics. 2010;11:234;Environ Sci Technol. 2012 Nov 6;46(21):11566-74;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Oct;54(10):4159-67;Front Microbiol. 2011 Jul 13;2:150;FEMS Microbiol Ecol. 2006 Jul;57(1):158-67;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2010 Sep;74(3):417-33;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2003 May;51(5):1109-17;Semin Cell Dev Biol. 2001 Jun;12(3):215-23;Water Sci Technol. 2001;43(6):1-8;Bioinformatics. 2007 Nov 1;23(21):2947-8;Water Res. 2011 Apr;45(9):2897-905;Front Microbiol. 2012 Dec 14;3:399;Chemosphere. 2009 Apr;75(4):435-41	MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 is a mung bean rhizosphere strain that produces secondary metabolites and hydrolytic enzymes contributing to excellent antifungal activity against Macrophomina phaseolina, one of the prevalent fungal pathogens of mung bean. Genome sequencing was performed using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine generating 1,354,732 reads (6,772,433 sequenced bases) achieving ~25-fold coverage of the genome. Reference genome assembly using MIRA 3.4.0 yielded 198 contigs. The draft genome of PGPR2 encoded 6803 open reading frames, of which 5314 were genes with predicted functions, 1489 were genes of known functions, and 80 were RNA-coding genes. Strain specific and core genes of P. aeruginosa PGPR2 that are relevant to rhizospheric habitat were identified by pangenome analysis. Genes involved in plant growth promoting function such as synthesis of ACC deaminase, indole-3-acetic acid, trehalose, mineral scavenging siderophores, hydrogen cyanide, chitinases, acyl homoserine lactones, acetoin, 2,3-butanediol, and phytases were identified. In addition, niche-specific genes such as phosphate solubilising 3-phytase, adhesins, pathway-specific transcriptional regulators, a diguanylate cyclase involved in cellulose synthesis, a receptor for ferrienterochelin, a DEAD/DEAH-box helicase involved in stress tolerance, chemotaxis/motility determinants, an HtpX protease, and enzymes involved in the production of a chromanone derivative with potent antifungal activity were identified.	2014		123058	10.1155/2014/123058	Illakkiam;Shankar;Ponraj;Rajendhran;Gunasekaran	Devaraj;Manoharan;Paramasivan;Jeyaprakash;Paramasamy	Department of Genetics, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, Tamilnadu 625021, India.;Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.;Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, John Innes Center, Norwich Research Park, Norwich NR4 7UH, UK.;Department of Genetics, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, Tamilnadu 625021, India.;Department of Genetics, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, Tamilnadu 625021, India.	eng	Methods Mol Biol. 2000;132:115-30;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2010 Aug;76(15):4933-42;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jul;37(Web Server issue):W174-8;Environ Microbiol. 2013 Oct;15(10 ):2658-71;J Bacteriol. 1993 Mar;175(5):1392-404;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jun 1;30(11):2478-83;Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Jan;40(Database issue):D742-53;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W116-20;J Biol Chem. 1986 Aug 15;261(23):10797-801;Curr Microbiol. 2003 May;46(5):324-8;Indian J Exp Biol. 2013 Nov;51(11):1024-31;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2008 Aug;21(8):1067-75;Bioinformatics. 2009 Jan 1;25(1):119-20;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Microbes Infect. 2000 Jul;2(9):1051-60;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Jan 12;107(2):686-91;J Bacteriol. 2011 Sep;193(18):4685-98;Microbes Environ. 2012;27(4):462-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jan;36(Database issue):D480-4;BMC Genomics. 2008 Feb 08;9:75;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Dec 1;27(23):4636-41;Phytopathology. 2012 Oct;102(10):967-73;Phytopathology. 2008 Jun;98(6):666-72;Infect Immun. 2006 Mar;74(3):1673-82;J Bacteriol. 1998 Jun;180(12):3187-96;J Exp Bot. 2008;59(3):633-44;BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 Sep 15;11:461;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Jul;35(Web Server issue):W52-7;J Antibiot (Tokyo). 2001 Jan;54(1):56-65;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007;35(9):3100-8;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2006 Aug;19(8):924-30;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2001 Oct 16;204(1):163-7;Curr Microbiol. 2010 Jul;61(1):64-8;Can J Microbiol. 2003 Feb;49(2):85-91;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 Feb;74(3):723-30;Bioinformatics. 2005 Aug 15;21(16):3422-3;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2009 Jul;296(1):52-9;Can J Microbiol. 1996 Mar;42(3):207-20;J Appl Microbiol. 2005;98(1):145-54;Genome Res. 2004 Jul;14(7):1394-403;Appl Biochem Biotechnol. 2013 Dec;171(8):2176-85;BMC Genomics. 2011 Aug 31;12:438;PLoS One. 2009;4(2):e4358;Microbes Environ. 2010;25(2):67-74;Annu Rev Plant Biol. 2008;59:417-41;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1996 Mar;62(3):865-71	PubMed-not-MEDLINE	ppublish

The redox-regulated transcription factor SoxR is conserved in diverse bacteria, but emerging studies suggest that this protein plays distinct physiological roles in different bacteria. SoxR regulates a global oxidative stress response (involving > 100 genes) against exogenous redox-cycling drugs in Escherichia coli and related enterics. In the antibiotic producers Streptomyces coelicolor and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, SoxR regulates a smaller number of genes that encode membrane transporters and proteins with homology to antibiotic-tailoring enzymes. In both S. coelicolor and P. aeruginosa, SoxR-regulated genes are expressed in stationary phase during the production of endogenously-produced redox-active antibiotics. These observations suggest that SoxR evolved to sense endogenous secondary metabolites and activate machinery to process and transport them in antibiotic-producing bacteria. Previous bioinformatics analysis that searched the genome for SoxR-binding sites in putative promoters defined a five-gene SoxR regulon in S. coelicolor including an ABC transporter, two oxidoreductases, a monooxygenase and an epimerase/dehydratase. Since this in silico screen may have missed potential SoxR-targets, we conducted a whole genome transcriptome comparison of wild type S. coelicolor and a soxR-deficient mutant in stationary phase using RNA-Seq. Our analysis revealed a sixth SoxR-regulated gene in S. coelicolor that encodes a putative quinone oxidoreductase. Knowledge of the full complement of genes regulated by SoxR will facilitate studies to elucidate the function of this regulatory molecule in antibiotic producers.	9	8	e106181	10.1371/journal.pone.0106181	Naseer;Shapiro;Chander	Nawar;Joshua A;Monica	Department of Biology, Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, United States of America.;Department of Biology, Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, United States of America.;Department of Biology, Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, United States of America.	eng	Genome Biol. 2010;11(8):R86;Bioinformatics. 2010 Mar 15;26(6):841-2;J Bacteriol. 2011 Jan;193(1):75-81;Nat Biotechnol. 2011 Jan;29(1):24-6;J Bacteriol. 2012 Jan;194(2):209-17;Mol Microbiol. 2013 Jan;87(2):368-81;Methods Mol Biol. 2000;132:365-86;J Bacteriol. 2001 Jul;183(13):3890-902;Genes Dev. 2001 Dec 1;15(23):3183-92;J Biol Chem. 2002 Apr 12;277(15):12507-15;Nature. 2002 May 9;417(6885):141-7;EMBO J. 2003 Jan 15;22(2):205-15;J Bacteriol. 1990 Aug;172(8):4197-205;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Aug;87(16):6181-5;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;J Bacteriol. 1991 May;173(9):2864-71;Nucleic Acids Res. 1991 Aug 25;19(16):4479-84;J Bacteriol. 1992 Oct;174(19):6054-60;Mol Microbiol. 1996 Jul;21(2):385-96;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Apr 15;25(8):1469-75;J Biochem. 2004 Nov;136(5):607-15;Infect Immun. 2005 May;73(5):2958-66;Genome Res. 2005 Oct;15(10):1451-5;Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 Mar 3;341(1):51-6;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Sep;61(5):1308-21;J Bacteriol. 2006 Dec;188(24):8669-73;Science. 2008 Aug 29;321(5893):1203-6;Bioinformatics. 2009 Jun 1;25(11):1422-3;Bioinformatics. 2009 Jul 15;25(14):1754-60;Brief Bioinform. 2013 Mar;14(2):178-92;Mol Microbiol. 2013 Dec;90(5):983-96;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;Curr Protoc Mol Biol. 2010 Jan;Chapter 19:Unit 19.10.1-21;J Bacteriol. 2010 Dec;192(24):6428-38	MEDLINE	epublish

Based on genotyping and host range, two newly isolated lytic bacteriophages, myovirus vB_AbaM_Acibel004 and podovirus vB_AbaP_Acibel007, active against Acinetobacter baumannii clinical strains, were selected from a new phage library for further characterization. The complete genomes of the two phages were analyzed. Both phages are characterized by broad host range and essential features of potential therapeutic phages, such as short latent period (27 and 21 min, respectively), high burst size (125 and 145, respectively), stability of activity in liquid culture and low frequency of occurrence of phage-resistant mutant bacterial cells. Genomic analysis showed that while Acibel004 represents a novel bacteriophage with resemblance to some unclassified Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages, Acibel007 belongs to the well-characterized genus of the Phikmvlikevirus. The newly isolated phages can serve as potential candidates for phage cocktails to control A. baumannii infections.	9	8	e104853	10.1371/journal.pone.0104853	Merabishvili;Vandenheuvel;Kropinski;Mast;De Vos;Verbeken;Noben;Lavigne;Vaneechoutte;Pirnay	Maia;Dieter;Andrew M;Jan;Daniel;Gilbert;Jean-Paul;Rob;Mario;Jean-Paul	Laboratory for Molecular and Cellular Technology (LabMCT), Queen Astrid Military Hospital, Brussels, Belgium; Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology and Virology, Tbilisi, Georgia; Laboratory for Bacteriology Research (LBR), Faculty Medicine & Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.;Laboratory of Gene Technology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Laboratory for Foodborne Zoonoses, Public Health Agency of Canada, Guelph, Ontario, Canada; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.;Electron Microscopy Unit, Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre, Brussels, Belgium.;Laboratory for Molecular and Cellular Technology (LabMCT), Queen Astrid Military Hospital, Brussels, Belgium.;Laboratory for Molecular and Cellular Technology (LabMCT), Queen Astrid Military Hospital, Brussels, Belgium.;Department of Pathology, Bacteriology and Poultry Diseases, Ghent University, Merelbeke, Belgium.;Laboratory of Gene Technology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Laboratory for Bacteriology Research (LBR), Faculty Medicine & Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.;Laboratory for Molecular and Cellular Technology (LabMCT), Queen Astrid Military Hospital, Brussels, Belgium.	eng	J Bacteriol. 2006 Oct;188(19):6924-31;Arch Virol. 2012 Apr;157(4):733-8;J Mol Biol. 2001 Jan 19;305(3):567-80;Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz. 2011 Jun;106(4):505-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Jan 15;26(2):544-8;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2012 Jul;332(1):40-6;Clin Infect Dis. 2010 Jul 1;51(1):79-84;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104;Lancet Infect Dis. 2006 Jun;6(6):317-8;J Virol. 2012 Nov;86(22):12437-8;FEBS J. 2005 Oct;272(20):5101-9;Genome Res. 2007 Oct;17(10):1486-95;Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2012 Jun;33(6):642-3;Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Nov 15;29(22):4724-35;Bioinformatics. 2011 Apr 1;27(7):1009-10;J Mol Biol. 2001 Nov 9;313(5):1003-11;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2006 May;258(1):72-7;Mol Biol Evol. 2011 Oct;28(10):2731-9;Nat Methods. 2011;8(10):785-6;Microbiology. 2009 Jul;155(Pt 7):2333-41;Comput Appl Biosci. 1988 Mar;4(1):11-7;Bioinformatics. 2004 Mar 22;20(5):629-35;Dokl Biochem Biophys. 2007 Jan-Feb;412:15-7;Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2013 Apr;11(4):383-93;Curr Microbiol. 2013 Jun;66(6):535-43;Microb Pathog. 1996 Sep;21(3):183-92;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Feb;51(4):1169-83;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2775-7;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2008 Jul;21(3):538-82;PLoS One. 2009;4(3):e4944;Gene. 2012 Oct 10;507(2):125-34;Genomics. 2011 Apr;97(4):249-55;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2007 Apr;59(4):772-4;Trends Genet. 2000 Jun;16(6):276-7;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Dec 1;27(23):4636-41;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004;32(1):11-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Oct 1;27(19):3911-20;J Med Microbiol. 2009 Jun;58(Pt 6):839-41;J Med Microbiol. 2012 Jan;61(Pt 1):137-41;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2008 Jul;32(1):29-32;Microbiology. 2006 Feb;152(Pt 2):529-34;Proc Int Conf Intell Syst Mol Biol. 1994;2:28-36;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2012 Jul;67(7):1607-15;J Clin Microbiol. 2006 Aug;44(8):2974-6;Lett Appl Microbiol. 2005;41(5):375-8;Bioinformatics. 2005 Apr 1;21(7):951-60;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1968 Sep;61(1):114-21;Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2013 Apr;11(4):395-409;Emerg Infect Dis. 2005 Aug;11(8):1218-24;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2011 Oct;77(19):6755-62;PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e46537;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010 Feb;65(2):233-8;Res Microbiol. 2010 May;161(4):308-14;BMC Microbiol. 2012;12:156;J Glob Infect Dis. 2010 Sep;2(3):291-304;Ann Surg. 2007 May;245(5):803-11;PLoS One. 2011;6(2):e16963;Clin Infect Dis. 2009 Jan 1;48(1):1-12;Res Microbiol. 2007 Sep;158(7):572-81;Virulence. 2011 Mar-Apr;2(2):97-102;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2011 Nov;17(11):1691-7;Yonsei Med J. 2009 Dec 31;50(6):764-70;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 May;57(5):2121-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;PLoS One. 2013;8(5):e62933	MEDLINE	epublish

Chronic bacterial lung infections associated with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis represent a substantial and growing health-care burden. Where Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the numerically dominant species within these infections, prognosis is significantly worse. However, in many individuals, Haemophilus influenzae predominates, a scenario associated with less severe disease. The mechanisms that determine which pathogen is most abundant are not known. We hypothesised that the distribution of H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa would be consistent with strong interspecific competition effects. Further, we hypothesised that where P. aeruginosa is predominant, it is associated with a distinct 'accessory microbiota' that reflects a significant interaction between this pathogen and the wider bacterial community. To test these hypotheses, we analysed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing data generated previously from 60 adult bronchiectasis patients, whose airway microbiota was dominated by either P. aeruginosa or H. influenzae. The relative abundances of the two dominant species in their respective groups were not significantly different, and when present in the opposite pathogen group the two species were found to be in very low abundance, if at all. These findings are consistent with strong competition effects, moving towards competitive exclusion. Ordination analysis indicated that the distribution of the core microbiota associated with each pathogen, readjusted after removal of the dominant species, was significantly divergent (analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), R=0.07, P=0.019). Taken together, these findings suggest that both interspecific competition and also direct and/or indirect interactions between the predominant species and the wider bacterial community may contribute to the predominance of P. aeruginosa in a subset of bronchiectasis lung infections.	9	1	217-25	10.1038/ismej.2014.124	Rogers;van der Gast;Serisier	Geraint B;Christopher J;David J	1] SAHMRI Infection and Immunity Theme, School of Medicine, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [2] Immunity, Infection, and Inflammation Program, Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.;NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Wallingford, UK.;1] Immunity, Infection, and Inflammation Program, Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia [2] Department of Respiratory Medicine, Mater Adult Hospital, South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.	eng	Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2005 Jun 1;171(11):1209-23;Microbiology. 2010 Jul;156(Pt 7):2058-67;Int J Med Microbiol. 2010 Dec;300(8):549-56;Respir Med. 2011 Jun;105(6):946-9;Thorax. 2013 Sep;68(9):812-7;Eur Respir J. 1996 Aug;9(8):1601-4;ISME J. 2011 May;5(5):780-91;Microbes Environ. 2013;28(1):13-24;Metabolomics. 2013 Dec;9(6):null;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2008 May 1;177(9):995-1001;JAMA. 2013 Mar 27;309(12):1260-7;Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2013 Jun;11(3):299-304;Thorax. 2013 Aug;68(8):731-7;Chest. 2007 Nov;132(5):1565-72;Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2014 Sep;11(7):1039-48;Respir Med. 2007 Jun;101(6):1163-70;Innate Immun. 2012 Oct;18(5):774-83;Lancet Respir Med. 2013 May;1(3):262-74;Lung. 2012 Oct;190(5):579-81;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Nov;42(11):5176-83;Chest. 2010 Oct;138(4):944-9;Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2012 Sep;16(9):859-73;Thorax. 2012 Oct;67(10):867-73;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2013 Sep;346(2):81-9;Chest. 1998 Dec;114(6):1594-8;Chest. 1999 Oct;116(4):1063-74;FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 2012 Jul;65(2):377-80;Anaerobe. 2010 Aug;16(4):337-44;J Clin Microbiol. 2003 Aug;41(8):3548-58;Anaerobe. 2008 Dec;14(6):297-300;Thorax. 1981 Sep;36(9):659-64;Trends Microbiol. 2013 Jun;21(6):271-6;ISME J. 2013 Apr;7(4):697-706;N Engl J Med. 2002 May 2;346(18):1383-93;Drugs Today (Barc). 2012 May;48(5):339-51;Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2014 May;11(4):496-503;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2013 May 15;187(10):1118-26;Respir Med. 2013 Jul;107(7):1001-7;Integr Biol (Camb). 2012 Mar;4(3):270-9	MEDLINE	ppublish

The Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing (QS) systems contribute to bacterial homeostasis and pathogenicity. Although the AraC-family transcription factor VqsM has been characterized to control the production of virulence factors and QS signaling molecules, its detailed regulatory mechanisms still remain elusive. Here, we report that VqsM directly binds to the lasI promoter region, and thus regulates its expression. To identify additional targets of VqsM in P. aeruginosa PAO1, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) and detected 48 enriched loci harboring VqsM-binding peaks in the P. aeruginosa genome. The direct regulation of these genes by VqsM has been confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions. A VqsM-binding motif was identified by using the MEME suite and verified by footprint assays in vitro. In addition, VqsM directly bound to the promoter regions of the antibiotic resistance regulator NfxB and the master type III secretion system (T3SS) regulator ExsA. Notably, the vqsM mutant displayed more resistance to two types of antibiotics and promoted bacterial survival in a mouse model, compared to wild-type PAO1. Collectively, this work provides new cues to better understand the detailed regulatory networks of QS systems, T3SS, and antibiotic resistance.	42	16	10307-20	10.1093/nar/gku586	Liang;Deng;Li;Ye;Wu	Haihua;Xin;Xuefeng;Yan;Min	Key Laboratory of Resources Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, ShaanXi 710069, China Department of Chemistry and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA lianghh@nwu.edu.cn.;Department of Chemistry and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.;Department of Basic Science, School of Medicine and Health Science, University of North Dakota, 501 North Columbia Rd, EJRF Building, Room 2726, ND 58203, USA.;Department of Basic Science, School of Medicine and Health Science, University of North Dakota, 501 North Columbia Rd, EJRF Building, Room 2726, ND 58203, USA.;Department of Basic Science, School of Medicine and Health Science, University of North Dakota, 501 North Columbia Rd, EJRF Building, Room 2726, ND 58203, USA.	eng	Science. 1993 May 21;260(5111):1127-30;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Jan 4;91(1):197-201;J Bacteriol. 1994 Jul;176(13):3832-38;Gene. 1995 May 26;158(1):15-22;Trends Microbiol. 1995 Sep;3(9):351-6;Mol Microbiol. 1996 Sep;21(6):1137-46;J Bacteriol. 1997 May;179(10):3127-32;Mol Microbiol. 1997 Nov;26(4):621-9;Gene. 1998 May 28;212(1):77-86;Mol Microbiol. 1998 Oct;30(2):295-304;J Bacteriol. 1999 Apr;181(7):2175-84;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Sep 28;96(20):11229-34;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Nov 9;101(45):15833-9;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2004 Dec;68(4):771-95;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jul;187(13):4372-80;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Oct;58(2):552-64;J Bacteriol. 2006 Jan;188(2):815-9;Infect Immun. 2006 Mar;74(3):1673-82;Int J Med Microbiol. 2006 Apr;296(2-3):73-81;J Biomol Tech. 2006 Apr;17(2):103-13;Eur J Immunol. 2006 Jul;36(7):1739-52;J Bacteriol. 2007 May;189(9):3603-12;Mol Microbiol. 2008 May;68(3):657-71;J Bacteriol. 2008 Sep;190(18):6217-27;Genome Biol. 2008;9(9):R137;PLoS One. 2009;4(3):e4891;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2009 Apr;12(2):182-91;Bioinformatics. 2009 May 1;25(9):1105-11;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jul;37(Web Server issue):W202-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Jan 12;107(2):686-91;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Apr 27;107(17):7916-21;Infect Immun. 2011 Jan;79(1):75-87;J Biol Chem. 2011 Jun 17;286(24):21814-25;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2012 Mar;76(1):46-65;PLoS Pathog. 2012;8(3):e1002621;J Bacteriol. 2012 Jun;194(12):3098-108;PLoS Pathog. 2012 Sep;8(9):e1002945;Nat Chem Biol. 2013 May;9(5):339-43;PLoS Pathog. 2014 Jan;10(1):e1003889;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Aug 1;97(16):8789-93;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Feb 27;98(5):2752-7;Adv Microb Physiol. 2001;45:199-270;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Dec 4;98(25):14589-94;Protein Expr Purif. 2002 Jun;25(1):8-15;J Bacteriol. 2002 Dec;184(23):6472-80;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2003 Feb;6(1):56-60;Gene Ther. 2003 Aug;10(17):1429-36;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Dec;50(5):1477-91;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2004 Jan 15;230(1):27-34;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 3;101(5):1339-44;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1987 Apr;31(4):582-6;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1991 Mar 15;63(1):31-5	MEDLINE	ppublish

Virol.	1098-5514	Development of giant bacteriophage ϕKZ is independent of the host transcription apparatus.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage ϕKZ is the type representative of the giant phage genus, which is characterized by unusually large virions and genomes. By unraveling the transcriptional map of the ∼ 280-kb ϕKZ genome to single-nucleotide resolution, we combine 369 ϕKZ genes into 134 operons. Early transcription is initiated from highly conserved AT-rich promoters distributed across the ϕKZ genome and located on the same strand of the genome. Early transcription does not require phage or host protein synthesis. Transcription of middle and late genes is dependent on protein synthesis and mediated by poorly conserved middle and late promoters. Unique to ϕKZ is its ability to complete its infection in the absence of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) enzyme activity. We propose that transcription of the ϕKZ genome is performed by the consecutive action of two ϕKZ-encoded, noncanonical multisubunit RNAPs, one of which is packed within the virion, another being the product of early genes. This unique, rifampin-resistant transcriptional machinery is conserved within the diverse giant phage genus.;The data presented in this paper offer, for the first time, insight into the complex transcriptional scheme of giant bacteriophages. We show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa giant phage ϕKZ is able to infect and lyse its host cell and produce phage progeny in the absence of functional bacterial transcriptional machinery.

Animal host defense against infection requires the expression of defense genes at the right place and the right time. Understanding such tight control of host defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. By using an unbiased approach in the model Caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that HLH-30 (known as TFEB in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host defense. HLH-30 was activated shortly after Staphylococcus aureus infection, and drove the expression of close to 80% of the host response, including antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection. TFEB was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon S. aureus infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Thus, our data suggest that TFEB is a previously unappreciated, evolutionarily ancient transcription factor in the host response to infection.	40	6	896-909	10.1016/j.immuni.2014.05.002	Visvikis;Ihuegbu;Labed;Luhachack;Alves;Wollenberg;Stuart;Stormo;Irazoqui	Orane;Nnamdi;Sid A;Lyly G;Anna-Maria F;Amanda C;Lynda M;Gary D;Javier E	Laboratory of Comparative Immunology, Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.;Department of Genetics, Center for Genome Sciences, Washington University Medical School, Saint Louis, Missouri 63118, USA.;Laboratory of Comparative Immunology, Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.;Laboratory of Comparative Immunology, Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.;Laboratory of Comparative Immunology, Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.;Laboratory of Comparative Immunology, Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.;Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.;Department of Genetics, Center for Genome Sciences, Washington University Medical School, Saint Louis, Missouri 63118, USA.;Laboratory of Comparative Immunology, Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.	eng	Autophagy. 2011 Nov;7(11):1379-81;Nat Rev Immunol. 2011 Dec;11(12):873-80;Dev Comp Immunol. 2012 Mar;36(3):502-20;Nat Commun. 2013;4:2267;EMBO Mol Med. 2013 May;5(5):691-706;J Comput Biol. 2012 Feb;19(2):139-47;EMBO J. 2012 Mar 7;31(5):1095-108;Annu Rev Immunol. 2012;30:271-94;Sci Signal. 2012 Jun 12;5(228):ra42;Biochem J. 2012 Jul 15;445(2):205-12;Autophagy. 2012 Jun;8(6):903-14;PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e44255;Annu Rev Physiol. 2013;75:241-62;Autophagy. 2013 Mar;9(3):278-86;EMBO Mol Med. 2013 Mar;5(3):397-412;Genes Dev. 2013 Apr 15;27(8):955-69;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 May 7;110(19):E1817-26;Nat Cell Biol. 2013 Jun;15(6):668-76;Nat Cell Biol. 2013 Jun;15(6):647-58;Nat Cell Biol. 2013 Jun;15(6):565-7;Cell Host Microbe. 2013 Jun 12;13(6):723-34;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 17;101(33):12312-7;Genetics. 1974 May;77(1):71-94;Genes Dev. 1994 Nov 15;8(22):2770-80;Science. 1999 May 21;284(5418):1313-8;Infect Immun. 2005 Feb;73(2):872-7;Genome Res. 2006 Aug;16(8):1005-16;PLoS Genet. 2006 Nov 10;2(11):e183;Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2006 Dec;70(12):3084-7;Annu Rev Immunol. 2007;25:697-743;Nature. 2007 Oct 18;449(7164):819-26;Nat Genet. 2007 Nov;39(11):1403-9;Methods Mol Biol. 2008;415:403-27;Immunobiology. 2008;213(3-4):237-50;Cell Host Microbe. 2008 Jun 12;3(6):352-63;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Nov 11;105(45):17469-74;J Biomol Screen. 2009 Feb;14(2):151-60;PLoS One. 2009;4(4):e5210;Science. 2009 Jul 24;325(5939):473-7;Cell. 2009 Jul 23;138(2):314-27;WormBook. 2009;:1-26;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Aug 25;106(34):14564-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Sep 15;106(37):15525-6;Science. 2009 Oct 9;326(5950):257-63;Nat Rev Immunol. 2009 Oct;9(10):692-703;Nat Rev Immunol. 2010 Jan;10(1):47-58;PLoS Pathog. 2010;6:e1000982;BMC Bioinformatics. 2010;11:415;Nat Cell Biol. 2010 Sep;12(9):842-6;PLoS One. 2010;5(9). pii: e13066. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0013066;Mol Cell. 2010 Oct 22;40(2):280-93;Nature. 2011 Jan 20;469(7330):323-35;Virulence. 2011 Mar-Apr;2(2):120-30;Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2011;349:25-60;PLoS One. 2011;6(5):e19055;Science. 2011 Jun 17;332(6036):1429-33;Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Jan;20(2):429-40;Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 May 1;29(9):e45;Infect Immun. 2003 Apr;71(4):2208-17;Nature. 2003 Jul 17;424(6946):277-83;Science. 2003 Sep 5;301(5638):1387-91;Dev Cell. 2004 Apr;6(4):577-88;Nat Rev Immunol. 2004 Jul;4(7):521-7;EMBO J. 2011 Aug 17;30(16):3242-58;PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24619	MEDLINE	ppublish

The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens poses a major threat for human health. In recent years, genome sequencing has unveiled many poorly expressed antibiotic clusters in actinomycetes. Here, we report a well-defined ecological collection of >800 actinomycetes obtained from sites in the Himalaya and Qinling mountains, and we used these in a concept study to see how efficiently antibiotics can be elicited against MDR pathogens isolated recently from the clinic. Using 40 different growth conditions, 96 actinomycetes were identified - predominantly Streptomyces - that produced antibiotics with efficacy against the MDR clinical isolates referred to as ESKAPE pathogens: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Enterobacter cloacae. Antimicrobial activities that fluctuated strongly with growth conditions were correlated with specific compounds, including borrelidin, resistomycin, carbomethoxy-phenazine, and 6,7,8- and 5,6,8-trimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarin, of which the latter was not described previously. Our work provided insights into the potential of actinomycetes as producers of drugs with efficacy against clinical isolates that have emerged recently and also underlined the importance of targeting a specific pathogen.	160	Pt 8	1714-1725	10.1099/mic.0.078295-0	Zhu;Swierstra;Wu;Girard;Choi;van Wamel;Sandiford;van Wezel	Hua;Jasper;Changsheng;Geneviève;Young Hae;Willem;Stephanie K;Gilles P	Molecular Biotechnology, Institute of Biology, Molecular Biotechnology, Leiden University, Sylviusweg 72, 2333 BE Leiden, The Netherlands.;Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Erasmus Medical Centre, 's Gravendijkwal 230, 3015 CE Rotterdam, The Netherlands.;Molecular Biotechnology, Institute of Biology, Molecular Biotechnology, Leiden University, Sylviusweg 72, 2333 BE Leiden, The Netherlands.;Molecular Biotechnology, Institute of Biology, Molecular Biotechnology, Leiden University, Sylviusweg 72, 2333 BE Leiden, The Netherlands.;Natural Products Laboratory, Institute of Biology, Leiden University, Sylviusweg 72, 2333 BE Leiden, The Netherlands.;Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Erasmus Medical Centre, 's Gravendijkwal 230, 3015 CE Rotterdam, The Netherlands.;Molecular Biotechnology, Institute of Biology, Molecular Biotechnology, Leiden University, Sylviusweg 72, 2333 BE Leiden, The Netherlands.;Molecular Biotechnology, Institute of Biology, Molecular Biotechnology, Leiden University, Sylviusweg 72, 2333 BE Leiden, The Netherlands.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen with a high incidence of hospital infections that represents a threat to immune compromised patients. Genomic studies have shown that, in contrast to other pathogenic bacteria, clinical and environmental isolates do not show particular genomic differences. In addition, genetic variability of all the P. aeruginosa strains whose genomes have been sequenced is extremely low. This low genomic variability might be explained if clinical strains constitute a subpopulation of this bacterial species present in environments that are close to human populations, which preferentially produce virulence associated traits.;In this work, we sequenced the genomes and performed phenotypic descriptions for four non-human P. aeruginosa isolates collected from a plant, the ocean, a water-spring, and from dolphin stomach. We show that the four strains are phenotypically diverse and that this is not reflected in genomic variability, since their genomes are almost identical. Furthermore, we performed a detailed comparative genomic analysis of the four strains studied in this work with the thirteen previously reported P. aeruginosa genomes by means of describing their core and pan-genomes.;Contrary to what has been described for other bacteria we have found that the P. aeruginosa core genome is constituted by a high proportion of genes and that its pan-genome is thus relatively small. Considering the high degree of genomic conservation between isolates of P. aeruginosa from diverse environments, including human tissues, some implications for the treatment of infections are discussed. This work also represents a methodological contribution for the genomic study of P. aeruginosa, since we provide a database of the comparison of all the proteins encoded by the seventeen strains analyzed.	15		318	10.1186/1471-2164-15-318	Grosso-Becerra;Santos-Medellín;González-Valdez;Méndez;Delgado;Morales-Espinosa;Servín-González;Alcaraz;Soberón-Chávez	María-Victoria;Christian;Abigail;José-Luis;Gabriela;Rosario;Luis;Luis-David;Gloria	Departamento de Biología Molecular y Biotecnología, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad Universitaria, 04510 México, DF, México. gloria@biomedicas.unam.mx.	eng	Appl Environ Microbiol. 1992 Oct;58(10):3276-82;Nature. 1970 Aug 15;227(5259):680-5;J Bacteriol. 2001 Feb;183(3):843-53;Bioinformatics. 2008 Dec 15;24(24):2818-24;J Basic Microbiol. 2008 Dec;48(6):509-15;BMC Bioinformatics. 2007;8:64;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:75;J Gen Microbiol. 1955 Dec;13(3):572-81;Appl Biochem Biotechnol. 2004 Jul-Sep;118(1-3):243-51;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2002 Jan 22;207(1):1-7;Curr Microbiol. 2009 Dec;59(6):621-7;BMC Genomics. 2010;11:332;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):821-9;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;PLoS Pathog. 2012 Sep;8(9):e1002945;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Apr 25;103(17):6565-70;Genome Biol. 2011;12(4):R40;BMC Genomics. 2011;12:438;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2009 Mar;33(2):376-93;Microb Ecol. 2010 Nov;60(4):708-20;Genome Biol. 2009;10(5):R51;J Bacteriol. 1997 Sep;179(18):5756-67;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;J Clin Microbiol. 2011 Mar;49(3):993-1003;Genome Announc. 2013 Aug 01;1(4):null;Crit Rev Microbiol. 1997;23(1):47-75;J Bacteriol. 2011 Dec;193(24):7010;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Oct 9;109(41):E2823-31;Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 1999 Sep;20(9):620-3;Microbiol Rev. 1996 Sep;60(3):539-74;PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e37459;PLoS One. 2009;4(11):e7740;Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):2200-11;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;Genome Biol. 2004;5(2):R12;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 8;100(14):8484-9;BMC Genomics. 2011;12:402;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Jun 10;94(12):6036-41;J Bacteriol. 2002 Jul;184(13):3605-13;J Bacteriol. 1990 Feb;172(2):867-83;PLoS One. 2010;5(10):e13482;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Nov 25;94(24):13245-50;Proteins. 2008 Feb 1;70(2):344-52;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2011 Jul;35(4):652-80;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2009 Oct;75(20):6568-80;Bioinformatics. 2010 Mar 1;26(5):680-2;Med Res Rev. 2009 Jan;29(1):65-124;Environ Microbiol. 2013 Mar;15(3):764-79;Brief Bioinform. 2004 Jun;5(2):150-63;Genome Biol. 2012;13(6):R56;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1998 Jun 15;163(2):185-92;PLoS One. 2010;5(1):e8842;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2009 Apr;12(2):182-91;Bioinformatics. 2011 Feb 15;27(4):578-9;J Bacteriol. 1995 Feb;177(4):948-52;Mol Microbiol. 2010 Dec;78(6):1510-22;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Dec 24;99(26):17020-4;Environ Microbiol. 2013 Jan;15(1):191-210	MEDLINE	epublish

Bacteriol.	1098-5530	Steady-state hydrogen peroxide induces glycolysis in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be readily inhibited by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated direct oxidation of their catalytic active cysteines. Because of the rapid degradation of H2O2 by bacterial catalase, only steady-state but not one-dose treatment with H2O2 rapidly induces glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). We conducted transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses to globally profile the bacterial transcriptomes in response to a steady level of H2O2, which revealed profound transcriptional changes, including the induced expression of glycolytic genes in both bacteria. Our results revealed that the inactivation of GAPDH by H2O2 induces metabolic levels of glycolysis and the PPP; the elevated levels of fructose 1,6-biphosphate (FBP) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) lead to dissociation of their corresponding glycolytic repressors (GapR and HexR, respectively) from their cognate promoters, thus resulting in derepression of the glycolytic genes to overcome H2O2-stalled glycolysis in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Both GapR and HexR may directly sense oxidative stresses, such as menadione.	196	14	2499-513	10.1128/JB.01538-14	Deng;Liang;Ulanovskaya;Ji;Zhou;Sun;Lu;Hutchison;Lan;Wu;Cravatt;He	Xin;Haihua;Olesya A;Quanjiang;Tianhong;Fei;Zhike;Alan L;Lefu;Min;Benjamin F;Chuan	Department of Chemistry and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.;Department of Chemistry and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.;The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA Department of Chemical Physiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA.;Department of Chemistry and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.;Department of Chemistry and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.;Department of Chemistry and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.;Department of Chemistry and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.;Department of Chemistry and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.;Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Pudong Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park, Shanghai, China.;Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, North Dakota, USA.;The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA Department of Chemical Physiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA.;Department of Chemistry and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA chuanhe@uchicago.edu.	eng	Infect Immun. 2006 Aug;74(8):4950-3;Microbiology. 2004 Apr;150(Pt 4):831-41;Nat Chem Biol. 2006 Nov;2(11):591-5;J Biol Chem. 2006 Dec 29;281(52):39860-9;Protein Sci. 2007 Nov;16(11):2368-77;Proteomics. 2008 Aug;8(15):3139-53;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Sep 9;105(36):13586-91;Nat Biotechnol. 2008 Nov;26(11):1251-9;Microbiology. 2008 Dec;154(Pt 12):3905-16;Nat Protoc. 2009;4(1):44-57;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Jan;71(1):198-211;Bioinformatics. 2009 May 1;25(9):1105-11;Nat Biotechnol. 2009 Jul;27(7):604-5;Nat Chem Biol. 2009 Aug;5(8):593-9;J Biol Chem. 2009 Aug 7;284(32):21360-8;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Dec;74(6):1445-58;Mol Microbiol. 2010 Jan;75(1):76-91;J Biol. 2007;6(4):10;Anal Biochem. 2010 Jun 15;401(2):250-9;Nat Biotechnol. 2010 May;28(5):511-5;Chem Biol. 2010 Aug 27;17(8):831-40;J Biol Chem. 2010 Nov 19;285(47):36785-93;Infect Immun. 2010 Dec;78(12):5223-32;Antioxid Redox Signal. 2011 Mar 15;14(6):1107-18;FASEB J. 2001 Jul;15(9):1569-74;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Jan;43(1):95-106;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 May 14;99(10):6690-5;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2002 Sep 24;215(1):89-95;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Mar;47(6):1709-21;Microbes Infect. 2003 Apr;5(4):301-10;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Jun;48(5):1317-23;Trends Microbiol. 2003 Aug;11(8):359-66;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2003 Dec;69(12):7401-8;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(1):248-52;J Bacteriol. 1987 Dec;169(12):5887-90;FASEB J. 1989 Dec;3(14):2574-82;Mol Microbiol. 1991 Jan;5(1):163-71;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Sep 17;93(19):10094-8;J Biol Chem. 1998 Mar 6;273(10):5744-51;Gene. 1998 May 28;212(1):77-86;Anal Biochem. 1978 Dec;91(2):557-65;Curr Opin Microbiol. 1999 Apr;2(2):188-94;Nat Rev Cancer. 2004 Nov;4(11):891-9;Science. 1956 Feb 24;123(3191):309-14;J Bacteriol. 2005 Apr;187(8):2565-72;FEBS J. 2005 May;272(10):2566-77;BMC Genomics. 2005;6:115;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(4):1648-59;Protein Expr Purif. 2006 Jun;47(2):446-54;J Biomol Tech. 2006 Apr;17(2):103-13;Nature. 2011 May 12;473(7346):216-20;Antioxid Redox Signal. 2011 Jul 15;15(2):311-24;Nat Chem Biol. 2011 Dec;7(12):894-901;J Am Chem Soc. 2012 Jan 11;134(1):305-14;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Jun 5;109(23):9095-100;J Biol Chem. 2012 Jun 15;287(25):21102-9;PLoS Pathog. 2012 Sep;8(9):e1002945;Nat Methods. 2012 Nov;9(11):1069-76;Cell Host Microbe. 2013 Mar 13;13(3):358-70;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):326-34;Cancer Res. 2006 Sep 15;66(18):8927-30	MEDLINE	ppublish

The whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, a notorious agricultural pest, has complex relationships with diverse microbes. The interactions of the whitefly with entomopathogens as well as its endosymbionts have received great attention, because of their potential importance in developing novel whitefly control technologies. To this end, a comprehensive understanding on the whitefly defense system is needed to further decipher those interactions.;We conducted a comprehensive investigation of the whitefly's defense responses to infection, via oral ingestion, of the pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, using RNA-seq technology. Compared to uninfected whiteflies, 6 and 24 hours post-infected whiteflies showed 1,348 and 1,888 differentially expressed genes, respectively. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that the mitogen associated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was activated after P. aeruginosa infection. Three knottin-like antimicrobial peptide genes and several components of the humoral and cellular immune responses were also activated, indicating that key immune elements recognized in other insect species are also important for the response of B. tabaci to pathogens. Our data also suggest that intestinal stem cell mediated epithelium renewal might be an important component of the whitefly's defense against oral bacterial infection. In addition, we show stress responses to be an essential component of the defense system.;We identified for the first time the key immune-response elements utilized by B. tabaci against bacterial infection. This study provides a framework for future research into the complex interactions between whiteflies and microbes.	9	4	e94477	10.1371/journal.pone.0094477	Zhang;Zhang;Xia;Li;Xia;Liu;Wang	Chang-Rong;Shan;Jun;Fang-Fang;Wen-Qiang;Shu-Sheng;Xiao-Wei	Ministry of Agriculture Key Laboratory of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Ministry of Agriculture Key Laboratory of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Ministry of Agriculture Key Laboratory of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Ministry of Agriculture Key Laboratory of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Ministry of Agriculture Key Laboratory of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Ministry of Agriculture Key Laboratory of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Ministry of Agriculture Key Laboratory of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	eng	Science. 2002 Dec 6;298(5600):1911-2;Immunol Rev. 2004 Apr;198:116-26;Annu Rev Entomol. 2011;56:1-19;Biochem J. 2006 May 15;396(1):127-38;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2004 Jun;70(6):3401-6;Curr Protein Pept Sci. 2004 Oct;5(5):341-349;Genome Res. 2008 Sep;18(9):1509-17;BMC Genomics. 2010;11:124;Insect Biochem Mol Biol. 1999 Jul;29(7):585-97;Annu Rev Entomol. 1998;43:17-37;Mol Cell. 2004 May 7;14(3):289-301;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Sep 6;108(36):14944-9;BMC Genomics. 2010;11:391;PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e35181;Biochim Biophys Acta. 2010 Nov;1800(11):1153-63;Immunobiology. 2006;211(4):213-36;BMC Evol Biol. 2013;13:228;FEBS Lett. 2001 Jan 19;488(3):190-5;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Nov 30;107(48):20774-9;Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Nov;19(11):7630-8;Microbes Infect. 2008 Jul;10(9):1082-8;Science. 1999 May 21;284(5418):1313-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Oct 18;108(42):17378-83;Nature. 2011 Jun 16;474(7351):380-4;Science. 2005 Dec 16;310(5755):1781;Nature. 2000 Nov 23;408(6811):433-9;Annu Rev Immunol. 2007;25:697-743;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2008 Apr;6(4):302-13;Genes Dev. 2009 Oct 1;23(19):2333-44;Dev Biol. 2011 Jun 1;354(1):31-43;BMC Biol. 2010;8:152;Mutat Res. 2005 Jan 6;569(1-2):101-10;Insect Sci. 2013 Dec;20(6):723-33;Genome. 1993 Dec;36(6):1007-14;Nature. 2006 Oct 26;443(7114):898-900;J Biol Chem. 2004 Oct 8;279(41):42703-8;Nat Rev Immunol. 2008 Nov;8(11):889-95;PLoS One. 2007;2(1):e182;Dev Biol. 2002 Jan 1;241(1):145-56;J Virol. 2011 Apr;85(7):3330-40;PLoS One. 2013;8(7):e68185;Science. 2011 Apr 8;332(6026):254-6;Genes Dev. 2004 Mar 1;18(5):584-94;Biol Lett. 2012 Dec 23;8(6):986-9;Cell Stem Cell. 2011 Jan 7;8(1):84-95;Insect Biochem Mol Biol. 2008 Jun;38(6):634-44;Mol Ecol. 2014 Mar;23(6):1433-44;BMC Genomics. 2010;11:400;J Biol Chem. 2003 Dec 5;278(49):48928-34;Dev Cell. 2002 Nov;3(5):711-22;J Econ Entomol. 2013 Jun;106(3):1446-55;Nat Genet. 2000 May;25(1):25-9;Genome Biol. 2010;11(2):R21;Cell Host Microbe. 2009 Feb 19;5(2):200-11;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Jan 1;27(1):29-34;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Dec;36(21):e141;Nat Protoc. 2009;4(9):1285-94;Insect Biochem Mol Biol. 2009 Oct;39(10):668-76;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2005;59:155-89;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2013 Sep;11(9):615-26;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2000 Feb;3(1):29-34;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Aug 9;102(32):11414-9;Science. 2009 Jul 17;325(5938):340-3;Cell. 2009 Jun 26;137(7):1343-55;Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2011;49:219-48	MEDLINE	epublish

A novel temperate bacteriophage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, phage vB_PaeP_Tr60_Ab31 (alias Ab31) is described. Its genome is composed of structural genes related to those of lytic P. putida phage AF, and regulatory genes similar to those of temperate phage PAJU2. The virion structure resembles that of phage AF and other lytic Podoviridae (S. enterica Epsilon 15 and E. coli phiv10) with similar tail spikes. Ab31 was able to infect P. aeruginosa strain PA14 and two genetically related strains called Tr60 and Tr162, out of 35 diverse strains from cystic fibrosis patients. Analysis of resistant host variants revealed different phenotypes, including induction of pigment and alginate overproduction. Whole genome sequencing of resistant variants highlighted the existence of a large deletion of 234 kbp in two strains, encompassing a cluster of genes required for the production of CupA fimbriae. Stable lysogens formed by Ab31 in strain Tr60, permitted the identification of the insertion site. During colonization of the lung in cystic fibrosis patients, P. aeruginosa adapts by modifying its genome. We suggest that bacteriophages such as Ab31 may play an important role in this adaptation by selecting for bacterial characteristics that favor persistence of bacteria in the lung.	9	4	e93777	10.1371/journal.pone.0093777	Latino;Essoh;Blouin;Vu Thien;Pourcel	Libera;Christiane;Yann;Hoang;Christine	Univ Paris-Sud, Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie, UMR 8621, Orsay, France; CNRS, Orsay, France.;Univ Paris-Sud, Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie, UMR 8621, Orsay, France; CNRS, Orsay, France.;Univ Paris-Sud, Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie, UMR 8621, Orsay, France; CNRS, Orsay, France.;Hôpital Armand Trousseau, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (APHP), Bactériologie, Paris, France.;Univ Paris-Sud, Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie, UMR 8621, Orsay, France; CNRS, Orsay, France.	eng	Microbiology. 2009 Apr;155(Pt 4):1050-7;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2009 Mar;292(2):182-6;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2010 Sep;8(9):623-33;Int J Med Microbiol. 2010 Dec;300(8):557-62;PLoS One. 2011;6(4):e18597;Virol J. 2011;8:194;Environ Microbiol. 2011 Jul;13(7):1690-704;Adv Exp Med Biol. 2012;726:143-79;Microbiology. 2012 Feb;158(Pt 2):474-87;Arch Virol. 2012 Apr;157(4):733-8;MBio. 2012;3(2). pii: e00061-12. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00061-12;Curr Opin Virol. 2011 Oct;1(4):298-303;Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):2200-11;Genetika. 2012 Sep;48(9):1057-67;Virology. 2012 Dec 20;434(2):251-6;J Bacteriol. 2013 Feb;195(4):798-806;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2013 May;79(9):2862-71;PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60575;PLoS One. 2013;8(5):e62933;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2013 Aug;68(8):1763-71;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2013 Oct;79(19):6110-6;PLoS One. 2013;8(9):e75380;J Mol Biol. 2000 May 26;299(1):27-51;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2001 Jun;67(6):2746-53;Cell. 2002 Jan 11;108(1):13-6;Int J Biol Macromol. 2002 Apr 8;30(2):105-11;Science. 2004 Sep 10;305(5690):1622-5;J Bacteriol. 2004 Oct;186(19):6560-74;J Bacteriol. 1973 Dec;116(3):1436-46;J Hyg (Lond). 1975 Oct;75(2):195-201;J Clin Microbiol. 1977 Jun;5(6):640-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 1977;4(5):1429-48;J Clin Microbiol. 1984 May;19(5):717-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Oct;81(19):6080-4;Thorax. 1987 Jul;42(7):526-32;J Mol Biol. 1988 Mar 20;200(2):351-65;Microbiol Rev. 1989 Dec;53(4):517-30;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1994 Jun;60(6):1734-8;J Bacteriol. 1994 Oct;176(19):6007-14;Science. 1995 Jun 30;268(5219):1899-902;J Gen Microbiol. 1955 Dec;13(3):572-81;J Bacteriol. 2004 Dec;186(23):8066-73;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W455-9;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2005 Aug;8(4):451-8;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(3):1184-7;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;J Bacteriol. 2007 May;189(9):3547-55;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 8;104(19):8107-12;Microbiology. 2007 Jun;153(Pt 6):1790-8;Cell Mol Life Sci. 2007 Jun;64(12):1484-97;J Clin Microbiol. 2007 Oct;45(10):3175-83;J Bacteriol. 2007 Dec;189(23):8667-76;Virology. 2007 Dec 20;369(2):234-44;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 May;36(9):e50;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2008 Oct;11(5):447-53;Virus Res. 2009 Jan;139(1):131-4;ISME J. 2009 Mar;3(3):271-82;Future Microbiol. 2010 Jul;5(7):1041-55	MEDLINE	epublish

Lett.	1574-6968	Genomic analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA96, the host of carbapenem resistance plasmid pOZ176.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA96 is a clinical isolate from Guangzhou, China, that is multiresistant to antibiotics. We previously described the 500-kb IncP-2 plasmid, pOZ176 that encodes many resistance genes including the IMP-9 carbapenemase. Whole-genome sequencing of PA96 enabled characterization of its genomic islands, virulence factors, and chromosomal resistance genes. We filled gaps using PCR and used optical mapping to confirm the correct contig order. We automatically annotated the core genome and manually annotated the genomic islands. The genome is 6 444 091 bp and encodes 5853 ORFs. From the whole-genome sequence, we constructed a physical map and constructed a phylogenetic tree for comparison with sequenced P. aeruginosa strains. Analysis of known core genome virulence factors and resistance genes revealed few differences with other strains, but the major virulence island is closer to that of DK2 than to PA14. PA96 most closely resembles the environmental strain M18, and notably shares a common serotype, pyoverdin type, flagellar operon, type IV pilin, and several genomic islands with M18.	356	2	212-6	10.1111/1574-6968.12435	Déraspe;Alexander;Xiong;Ma;Low;Jamieson;Roy	Maxime;David C;Jianhui;Jennifer H;Donald E;Frances B;Paul H	Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, CHU de Québec, Québec, QC, Canada; Département de Biochimie, de microbiologie, et de bio-informatique, Université Laval, Québec, QC, Canada.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish
202	24659602	2014	Jun			Print-Electronic	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	Pathogens and disease	Pathog Dis	2049-632X	The deletion of TonB-dependent receptor genes is part of the genome reduction process that occurs during adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to the cystic fibrosis lung.	Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are the main cause of morbidity among patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) due to persistent lung inflammation caused by interaction between this bacterium and the immune system. Longitudinal studies of clonally related isolates of a dominant CF clone have indicated that genome reduction frequently occurs during adaptation of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung. In this study, we have evaluated the P. aeruginosa population structure of patients attending the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel (UZ Brussel) CF reference center using a combination of genotyping methods. Although the UZ Brussel P. aeruginosa CF population is characterized by the absence of a dominant CF clone, some potential interpatient transmissions could be detected. Interestingly, one of these clones showed deletion of the alternative type I ferripyoverdine receptor gene fpvB. Furthermore, we found that several other TonB-dependent receptors are deleted as well. The genome of one potentially transmissible CF clone was sequenced, revealing large deleted regions including all type III secretion system genes and several virulence genes. Remarkably, a large number of deleted genes are shared between the P. aeruginosa CF clone described in this study and isolates belonging to the dominant Copenhagen CF DK2 clone, suggesting parallel evolution.	71	1	26-38	10.1111/2049-632X.12170	Dingemans;Ye;Hildebrand;Tontodonati;Craggs;Bilocq;De Vos;Crabbé;Van Houdt;Malfroot;Cornelis	Jozef;Lumeng;Falk;Francesca;Michael;Florence;Daniel;Aurélie;Rob;Anne;Pierre	Department of Bioengineering Sciences, Research Group Microbiology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel and VIB Structural Biology, Brussels, Belgium; Unit of Microbiology, Expert Group Molecular and Cellular Biology, Institute for Environment, Health and Safety, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre (SCK CEN), Mol, Belgium.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Agents Chemother.	1098-6596	Pseudomonas aeruginosa ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance development requires multiple mutations leading to overexpression and structural modification of AmpC.	We compared the dynamics and mechanisms of resistance development to ceftazidime, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and ceftolozane-tazobactam in wild-type (PAO1) and mutator (PAOMS, ΔmutS) P. aeruginosa. The strains were incubated for 24 h with 0.5 to 64× MICs of each antibiotic in triplicate experiments. The tubes from the highest antibiotic concentration showing growth were reinoculated in fresh medium containing concentrations up to 64× MIC for 7 consecutive days. The susceptibility profiles and resistance mechanisms were assessed in two isolated colonies from each step, antibiotic, and strain. Ceftolozane-tazobactam-resistant mutants were further characterized by whole-genome analysis through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The development of high-level resistance was fastest for ceftazidime, followed by meropenem and ciprofloxacin. None of the mutants selected with these antibiotics showed cross-resistance to ceftolozane-tazobactam. On the other hand, ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance development was much slower, and high-level resistance was observed for the mutator strain only. PAO1 derivatives that were moderately resistant (MICs, 4 to 8 μg/ml) to ceftolozane-tazobactam showed only 2 to 4 mutations, which determined global pleiotropic effects associated with a severe fitness cost. High-level-resistant (MICs, 32 to 128 μg/ml) PAOMS derivatives showed 45 to 53 mutations. Major changes in the global gene expression profiles were detected in all mutants, but only PAOMS mutants showed ampC overexpression, which was caused by dacB or ampR mutations. Moreover, all PAOMS mutants contained 1 to 4 mutations in the conserved residues of AmpC (F147L, Q157R, G183D, E247K, or V356I). Complementation studies revealed that these mutations greatly increased ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime MICs but reduced those of piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem, compared to those in wild-type ampC. Therefore, the development of high-level resistance to ceftolozane-tazobactam appears to occur efficiently only in a P. aeruginosa mutator background, in which multiple mutations lead to overexpression and structural modifications of AmpC.	58	6	3091-9	10.1128/AAC.02462-13	Cabot;Bruchmann;Mulet;Zamorano;Moyà;Juan;Haussler;Oliver	Gabriel;Sebastian;Xavier;Laura;Bartolomé;Carlos;Susanne;Antonio	Servicio de Microbiología and Unidad de Investigación Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa), Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.;Servicio de Microbiología and Unidad de Investigación Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa), Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Servicio de Microbiología and Unidad de Investigación Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa), Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Servicio de Microbiología and Unidad de Investigación Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa), Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Servicio de Microbiología and Unidad de Investigación Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa), Palma de Mallorca, Spain.;Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.;Servicio de Microbiología and Unidad de Investigación Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa), Palma de Mallorca, Spain antonio.oliver@ssib.es.	eng	Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Drugs. 2014 Jan;74(1):31-51;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2003 Oct;52(4):699-702;Gene. 1994 Oct 11;148(1):81-6;J Intern Med. 1998 Nov;244(5):379-86;J Clin Microbiol. 2005 Mar;43(3):1198-204;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2007 Jun;13(6):560-78;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007 Oct;51(10):3531-6;PLoS One. 2008;3(2):e1619;Microbiology. 2008 Jul;154(Pt 7):2119-30;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2008 Oct;52(10):3694-700;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2008 Dec;52(12):4486-91;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Jun;53(6):2522-31;Bioinformatics. 2009 Aug 15;25(16):2078-9;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2009 Nov;34(5):402-6;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009 Oct;22(4):582-610;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Jan;54(1):557-9;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Feb;54(2):846-51;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Mar;54(3):1213-7;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010 Jul;65(7):1399-404;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Sep;54(9):3933-7;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Oct;54(10):4159-67;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2010 Sep;16(9):1482-7;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 May;55(5):1906-11;Genome Res. 2011 Jun;21(6):936-9;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Feb;56(2):1128-32;PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31092;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Sep;56(9):4771-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Dec;56(12):6349-57;Clin Infect Dis. 2013 Jul;57(2):208-16;Lancet Infect Dis. 2013 Oct;13(10):867-76;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Nov;57(11):5527-35;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Dec;57(12):6305-10;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2002 Nov;46(11):3406-11	MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae is a reemerging pathogen which causes bacterial canker of kiwifruit (Actinidia sp.). Since 2008, a global outbreak of P. syringae pv. actinidiae has occurred, and in 2010 this pathogen was detected in New Zealand. The economic impact and the development of resistance in P. syringae pv. actinidiae and other pathovars against antibiotics and copper sprays have led to a search for alternative management strategies. We isolated 275 phages, 258 of which were active against P. syringae pv. actinidiae. Extensive host range testing on P. syringae pv. actinidiae, other pseudomonads, and bacteria isolated from kiwifruit orchards showed that most phages have a narrow host range. Twenty-four were analyzed by electron microscopy, pulse-field gel electrophoresis, and restriction digestion. Their suitability for biocontrol was tested by assessing stability and the absence of lysogeny and transduction. A detailed host range was performed, phage-resistant bacteria were isolated, and resistance to other phages was examined. The phages belonged to the Caudovirales and were analyzed based on morphology and genome size, which showed them to be representatives of Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae. Twenty-one Myoviridae members have similar morphologies and genome sizes yet differ in restriction patterns, host range, and resistance, indicating a closely related group. Nine of these Myoviridae members were sequenced, and each was unique. The most closely related sequenced phages were a group infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa and characterized by phages JG004 and PAK_P1. In summary, this study reports the isolation and characterization of P. syringae pv. actinidiae phages and provides a framework for the intelligent formulation of phage biocontrol agents against kiwifruit bacterial canker.	80	7	2216-28	10.1128/AEM.00062-14	Frampton;Taylor;Holguín Moreno;Visnovsky;Petty;Pitman;Fineran	Rebekah A;Corinda;Angela V;Sandra B;Nicola K;Andrew R;Peter C	Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.	eng	PLoS One. 2013;8(4):e60575;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2013 May;79(10):3249-56;J Biol Chem. 2008 May 16;283(20):13556-64;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:75;Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2010 Jan;11(1):48-57;Bioinformatics. 2012 Jun 15;28(12):1647-9;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104;PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36518;Bioinformatics. 2011 Apr 1;27(7):1009-10;J Bacteriol. 1984 Jan;157(1):165-70;Trends Microbiol. 1999 Mar;7(3):111-5;Microbiology. 1996 May;142 ( Pt 5):1107-14;BMC Microbiol. 2011;11:102;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 1994 Aug;14(4):381-6;Phytopathology. 2012 Nov;102(11):1034-44;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2009 Apr;75(7):2139-47;Future Microbiol. 2010 Jul;5(7):1041-55;Environ Microbiol. 2009 May;11(5):1303-13;Phytopathology. 2012 Sep;102(9):827-40;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2003 Apr;69(4):2133-8;PLoS Pathog. 2013;9(7):e1003503;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Sep;71(9):5182-91;Int J Microbiol. 2012;2012:326452;Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2007;45:245-62;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Sep 6;108(36):14932-7;Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2011;75(5):944-52;Nucleic Acids Res. 1988 Apr 11;16(7):2873-84;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004;32(1):11-6;Bacteriophage. 2011 Jan;1(1):46-49;BMC Genomics. 2011;12:402;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2007 Mar;73(6):1704-11;PLoS One. 2013;8(2):e57464;Mol Plant Pathol. 2012 Sep;13(7):631-40;Microbiology. 2006 Jun;152(Pt 6):1701-8;Viruses. 2012 Oct;4(10):2291-311;J Microbiol. 2004 Dec;42(4):365-8;BMC Genomics. 2013;14:481;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2011 Jun;77(12):4155-62;PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27297;PLoS One. 2012;7(3):e33227;Trends Biotechnol. 2007 Jan;25(1):7-15;J Bacteriol. 1995 Sep;177(17):5016-27;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2011 Jun;77(12):4089-96;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;PLoS One. 2013;8(5):e62933;J Bacteriol. 1991 Feb;173(3):1111-9	MEDLINE	ppublish

Microbiol. Infect.	1469-0691	Genome sequencing and characterization of an extensively drug-resistant sequence type 111 serotype O12 hospital outbreak strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	A series of extensively drug-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from two outbreaks in UK hospitals were characterized by whole genome sequencing (WGS). Although these isolates were resistant to antibiotics other than colistin, we confirmed that they are still sensitive to disinfectants. The sequencing confirmed that isolates in the larger outbreak were serotype O12, and also revealed that they belonged to sequence type ST111, which is a major epidemic strain of P. aeruginosa throughout Europe. As this is the first reported sequence of an ST111 strain, the genome was examined in depth, focusing particularly on antibiotic resistance and potential virulence genes, and on the reported regions of genome plasticity. High degrees of sequence similarity were discovered between outbreak isolates collected from recently infected patients, isolates from sinks, an isolate from the sewer, and a historical isolate, suggesting that the ST111 strain has been endemic in the hospital for many years. The ability to translate easily from outbreak investigation to detailed genome biology by use of the same data demonstrates the flexibility of WGS application in a clinical setting.	20	10	O609-18	10.1111/1469-0691.12528	Witney;Gould;Pope;Bolt;Stoker;Cubbon;Bradley;Fraise;Breathnach;Butcher;Planche;Hinds	A A;K A;C F;F;N G;M D;C R;A;A S;P D;T D;J	Division of Clinical Sciences, St George's University of London, London, UK.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

217	24376440	2013				Electronic-eCollection	Journal Article	Frontiers in microbiology	Front Microbiol	1664-302X	Vibrio campbellii hmgA-mediated pyomelanization impairs quorum sensing, virulence, and cellular fitness.	Melanization due to the inactivation of the homogentisate-1,2-dioxygenase gene (hmgA) has been demonstrated to increase stress resistance, persistence, and virulence in some bacterial species but such pigmented mutants have not been observed in pathogenic members of the Vibrio Harveyi clade. In this study, we used Vibrio campbellii ATCC BAA-1116 as model organism to understand how melanization affected cellular phenotype, metabolism, and virulence. An in-frame deletion of the hmgA gene resulted in the overproduction of a pigment in cell culture supernatants and cellular membranes that was identified as pyomelanin. Unlike previous demonstrations in Vibrio cholerae, Burkholderia cepacia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the pigmented V. campbellii mutant did not show increased UV resistance and was found to be ~2.7 times less virulent than the wild type strain in Penaeus monodon shrimp virulence assays. However, the extracted pyomelanin pigment did confer a higher resistance to oxidative stress when incubated with wild type cells. Microarray-based transcriptomic analyses revealed that the hmgA gene deletion and subsequent pyomelanin production negatively effected the expression of 129 genes primarily involved in energy production, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, and protein translation and turnover. This transcriptional response was mediated in part by an impairment of the quorum sensing regulon as transcripts of the quorum sensing high cell density master regulator LuxR and other operonic members of this regulon were significantly less abundant in the hmgA mutant. Taken together, the results suggest that the pyomelanization of V. campbellii sufficiently impairs the metabolic activities of this organism and renders it less fit and virulent than its isogenic wild type strain.	4		379	10.3389/fmicb.2013.00379	Wang;Lin;Mostaghim;Rubin;Glaser;Mittraparp-Arthorn;Thompson;Vuddhakul;Vora	Zheng;Baochuan;Anahita;Robert A;Evan R;Pimonsri;Janelle R;Varaporn;Gary J	Center for Bio/Molecular Science & Engineering, Naval Research Laboratory Washington, DC, USA.;Center for Bio/Molecular Science & Engineering, Naval Research Laboratory Washington, DC, USA.;Center for Bio/Molecular Science & Engineering, Naval Research Laboratory Washington, DC, USA ; School of Systems Biology, College of Science, George Mason University Fairfax, VA, USA.;Mathematics Department, Whittier College Whittier, CA, USA.;Division of Electronics Science and Technology, Naval Research Laboratory Washington, DC, USA.;Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University Hat Yai, Thailand.;Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, MA, USA.;Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University Hat Yai, Thailand.;Center for Bio/Molecular Science & Engineering, Naval Research Laboratory Washington, DC, USA.	eng	Immunol Rev. 2004 Apr;198:116-26;Gene. 1997 Feb 20;186(1):29-35;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2009 Jan;75(2):493-503;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2002 Aug;26(3):285-309;J Bacteriol. 2002 Oct;184(20):5633-40;Dev Comp Immunol. 2009 Jul;33(7):811-20;Microbiology. 2000 Feb;146 ( Pt 2):283-8;Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000 Dec 1;1494(3):226-35;BMC Bioinformatics. 2009 Sep 16;10:292;Cell. 2004 Jul 9;118(1):69-82;BMC Microbiol. 2011 May 18;11:109;Vet Microbiol. 2011 Dec 29;154(1-2):124-9;FEMS Microbiol Ecol. 2009 May;68(2):223-5;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jun;186(12):3794-805;Curr Microbiol. 2003 Nov;47(5):379-82;Lett Appl Microbiol. 2006 Aug;43(2):119-24;J Bacteriol. 2009 Jan;191(1):52-64;Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 May 19;1384(2):356-64;J Appl Microbiol. 2009 Apr;106(4):1388-96;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1995 Apr;61(4):1620-2;Mol Microbiol. 1993 Aug;9(4):773-86;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2004 Sep;68(3):403-31, table of contents;J Biol Chem. 1987 Oct 5;262(28):13805-11;Microbiology. 2009 Apr;155(Pt 4):1050-7;Infect Immun. 2009 Mar;77(3):935-42;Environ Microbiol Rep. 2010 Feb;2(1):81-89;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2000 May;66(5):2079-84;J Appl Microbiol. 2008 May;104(5):1480-7;Infect Immun. 1999 Feb;67(2):908-13;Environ Microbiol Rep. 2010 Feb;2(1):44-9;J Bacteriol. 2003 Jul;185(13):3842-52;J Appl Genet. 2002;43(3):377-89;Mol Microbiol. 2000 May;36(4):940-54;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2005 Sep 1;250(1):105-10;Genes Dev. 2007 Jan 15;21(2):221-33;J Bacteriol. 2004 Oct;186(20):6902-14;Dev Comp Immunol. 2009 Feb;33(2):247-56;Bioresour Technol. 2003 Apr;87(2):137-46;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2002 May;68(5):2436-44;Genes Dev. 2006 Oct 1;20(19):2754-67;Dis Aquat Organ. 2011 Aug 29;96(1):9-20;Plasmid. 1996 Jan;35(1):1-13;J Med Microbiol. 2004 Mar;53(Pt 3):175-81;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1992 Sep;58(9):2861-5;EMBO J. 2003 Feb 17;22(4):870-81;J Basic Microbiol. 2004;44(3):178-84;Curr Opin Microbiol. 1999 Dec;2(6):582-7	PubMed-not-MEDLINE	epublish

Res.	1746-6148	Novel bacteriophage therapy for controlling metallo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in catfish.	The bacteriophage therapy is an effective antimicrobial approach with potentially important applications in medicine and biotechnology which can be seen as an additional string in the bow. Emerging drug resistant bacteria in aquaculture industry due to unrestricted use of antibiotics warrants more sustainable and environmental friendly strategies for controlling fish infections.The isolated bacteria from fish lesions was characterised based on isolation on selective and differential medium like Pseudomonas agar, gram staining, biochemical tests and 16SrRNA sequencing. The metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producing bacterial isolate was evaluated using Imipenem - Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) disk method. The specific bacteriophage was isolated and concentrated using coal bed developed in our lab at CSIR-NEERI. The isolated and enriched bacteriophage was characterised by nucleotide sequencing and electron microscopy. The phage therapy was applied for treating ulcerative lesion in fish.;The pathogenic bacterium responsible for causing ulcerative lesions in catfish species (Clarias gariepinus) was identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One out of twenty P. aeruginosa isolate showing multi drug resistance (MDR) was incidentally found to be MBL producing as determined by Imipenem-EDTA disk method. The phage therapy effectively cured the ulcerative lesions of the infected fish in 8-10 days of treatment, with a sevenfold reduction of the lesion with untreated infection control.;Bacteriophage therapy can have potential applications soon as an alternative or as a complement to antibiotic treatment in the aquaculture. We present bacteriophage therapy as a treatment method for controlling MDR P. aeruginosa infection in C. gariepinus. To the best of our knowledge this is a first report of application of phage therapy against MBL producing P. aeruginosa isolated from aquatic ecosystem.	9		264	10.1186/1746-6148-9-264	Khairnar;Raut;Chandekar;Sanmukh;Paunikar	Krishna;Mahendra P;Rajshree H;Swapnil G;Waman N	Environmental Virology Cell, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI), Nehru Marg, Nagpur 440020, Maharashtra, India. kskhairnar@gmail.com.	eng	Dis Aquat Organ. 1999 Jun 23;37(1):33-41;Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000 Mar 6;1474(1):107-13;Avian Dis. 2005 Mar;49(1):118-24;J Clin Microbiol. 2005 Jul;43(7):3129-35;J Clin Microbiol. 2005 Oct;43(10):5344-7;Clin Infect Dis. 2005 Dec 1;41(11):1549-56;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006 Jan;50(1):388-90;Environ Microbiol. 2006 Jul;8(7):1137-44;J Environ Monit. 2006 Sep;8(9):923-31;Environ Microbiol. 2007 Feb;9(2):322-31;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007 Feb;51(2):446-52;Microbiol Immunol. 2007;51(3):271-7;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2000 Apr;66(4):1416-22;J Appl Microbiol. 2000 Oct;89(4):702-9;Arch Environ Contam Toxicol. 2002 Feb;42(2):256-62;Res Microbiol. 2002 Jan-Feb;153(1):13-8;Infect Immun. 2002 Aug;70(8):3985-93;J Clin Microbiol. 2002 Oct;40(10):3798-801;J Appl Microbiol. 2002;93(6):1089-98;J Infect Dis. 2003 Feb 15;187(4):613-24;Dis Aquat Organ. 2003 Jan 22;53(1):33-9;Dis Aquat Organ. 2003 Apr 24;54(3):187-94;J Microbiol Methods. 2003 Sep;54(3):411-8;Virology. 2003 Jul 20;312(1):49-59;J Fish Dis. 2003 Jan;26(1):55-8;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2003 Dec;52(6):967-73;Emerg Infect Dis. 2004 Mar;10(3):535-8;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2004 Sep;68(3):560-602, table of contents;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2004 Oct;48(10):3817-22;J Appl Bacteriol. 1988 Aug;65(2):97-101;Mol Mar Biol Biotechnol. 1994 Apr;3(2):57-69;J Infect. 1998 Jan;36(1):5-15;Clin Diagn Lab Immunol. 1998 May;5(3):294-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Mar;49(3):1220-1;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Nov 23;96(24):13910-3;J Fish Dis. 2009 Aug;32(8):713-22;J Fish Dis. 2007 Aug;30(8):505-7;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2007 Sep;57(Pt 9):1960-5;Arch Microbiol. 2007 Nov;188(5):547-50;J Aquat Anim Health. 2007 Mar;19(1):27-34;Water Environ Res. 2008 Mar;80(3):282-8;Curr Opin Biotechnol. 2008 Jun;19(3):260-5;Indian J Med Microbiol. 2008 Jul-Sep;26(3):243-5	MEDLINE	epublish
219	24359686	2013	Dec	20		Electronic	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	Genome biology	Genome Biol.	1474-760X	Transcriptomics-based screen for genes induced by flagellin and repressed by pathogen effectors identifies a cell wall-associated kinase involved in plant immunity.	Microbe-associated molecular patterns, such as those present in bacterial flagellin, are powerful inducers of the innate immune response in plants. Successful pathogens deliver virulence proteins, termed effectors, into the plant cell where they can interfere with the immune response and promote disease. Engineering the plant immune system to enhance disease resistance requires a thorough understanding of its components.;We describe a high-throughput screen, using RNA sequencing and virus-induced gene silencing, to identify tomato genes whose expression is enhanced by the flagellin microbe-associated molecular pattern flgII-28, but reduced by activities of the Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) type III effectors AvrPto and AvrPtoB. Gene ontology terms for this category of Flagellin-induced repressed by effectors (FIRE) genes showed enrichment for genes encoding certain subfamilies of protein kinases and transcription factors. At least 25 of the FIRE genes have been implicated previously in plant immunity. Of the 92 protein kinase-encoding FIRE genes, 33 were subjected to virus-induced gene silencing and their involvement in pattern-triggered immunity was tested with a leaf-based assay. Silencing of one FIRE gene, which encodes the cell wall-associated kinase SlWAK1, compromised the plant immune response resulting in increased growth of Pst and enhanced disease symptoms.;Our transcriptomic approach identifies FIRE genes that represent a pathogen-defined core set of immune-related genes. The analysis of this set of candidate genes led to the discovery of a cell wall-associated kinase that participates in plant defense. The FIRE genes will be useful for further elucidation of the plant immune system.	14	12	R139	10.1186/gb-2013-14-12-r139	Rosli;Zheng;Pombo;Zhong;Bombarely;Fei;Collmer;Martin	Hernan G;Yi;Marina A;Silin;Aureliano;Zhangjun;Alan;Gregory B		eng	Mol Plant. 2008 May;1(3):423-45;Plant J. 2007 Nov;52(4):595-614;Plant J. 2002 Nov;32(3):299-315;Cold Spring Harb Protoc. 2011 Aug;2011(8):940-9;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2010 Aug;23(8):991-9;Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2003;41:215-43;Front Plant Sci. 2013 Mar 13;4:49;Cell. 2002 Jul 26;110(2):203-12;Plant Mol Biol. 2009 Feb;69(3):337-46;Bioinformatics. 2004 Jun 12;20(9):1453-4;Plant J. 2002 Sep;31(6):777-86;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;Bioinformatics. 2009 May 1;25(9):1105-11;Nature. 2007 Jul 26;448(7152):497-500;Plant Cell. 2011 Apr;23(4):1273-92;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D1149-55;New Phytol. 2013 Nov;200(3):847-60;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Feb 15;108(7):2975-80;Mol Biol Evol. 2010 Feb;27(2):221-4;Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jan;41(Database issue):D590-6;Plant Physiol. 2002 Jun;129(2):455-9;Trends Microbiol. 2012 Apr;20(4):199-208;Cell Host Microbe. 2010 Apr 22;7(4):290-301;Bioinformatics. 2004 Dec 12;20(18):3710-5;Nature. 2010 Mar 18;464(7287):418-22;Nat Rev Genet. 2010 Aug;11(8):539-48;Nature. 2004 Apr 15;428(6984):764-7;J Vis Exp. 2009;(28). pii: 1292. doi: 10.3791/1292;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2010 Jun;23(6):715-26;Plant J. 2003 Feb;33(4):665-76;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2012 Dec;25(12):1523-30;Plant Mol Biol. 1999 Apr;39(6):1189-96;Bioinformatics. 2005 May 1;21(9):2104-5;Genetics. 2005 Sep;171(1):305-21;Plant Physiol. 2004 Jun;135(2):1113-28;PLoS One. 2010;5(1):e8904;Syst Biol. 2003 Oct;52(5):696-704;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 May 18;107(20):9452-7;Nat Methods. 2012 Aug;9(8):772;Plant J. 2003 Nov;36(4):485-99;Mol Plant. 2012 Jul;5(4):841-51;New Phytol. 2010 Sep;187(4):969-82;Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2013;51:473-98;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Sep 2;100(18):10181-6;PLoS One. 2012;7(9):e46451;Genome Biol. 2009;10(3):R25;Methods Mol Biol. 2000;132:365-86;Plant J. 2012 Jan;69(1):92-103;FEBS Lett. 2011 Jun 6;585(11):1521-8;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2011 Feb;14(1):54-61;Curr Biol. 2009 Mar 10;19(5):423-9;Plant Cell. 2006 Jan;18(1):257-73;Mol Cell. 2000 Jun;5(6):1003-11;PLoS Pathog. 2011 Aug;7(8):e1002130;Annu Rev Plant Biol. 2012;63:451-82;Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2008;46:101-22;Nature. 2012 May 31;485(7400):635-41;Front Plant Sci. 2012 May 08;3:88;PLoS Comput Biol. 2009 Dec;5(12):e1000598;Plant J. 2010 Jan;61(1):16-24;Plant J. 2006 Apr;46(1):14-33;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Jan 5;107(1):496-501;Plant J. 2006 Apr;46(1):34-53;Front Plant Sci. 2012 Dec 11;3:280	MEDLINE	epublish

U.S.A.	1091-6490	Evolutionary genomics of epidemic and nonepidemic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen of humans and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Prolonged infection of the respiratory tract can lead to adaptation of the pathogen to the CF lung environment. To examine the general patterns of adaptation associated with chronic infection, we obtained genome sequences from a collection of P. aeruginosa isolated from airways of patients with CF. Our analyses support a nonclonal epidemic population structure, with a background of unique, recombining genotypes, and the rare occurrence of successful epidemic clones. We present unique genome sequence evidence for the intercontinental spread of an epidemic strain shared between CF clinics in the United Kingdom and North America. Analyses of core and accessory genomes identified candidate genes and important functional pathways associated with adaptive evolution. Many genes of interest were involved in biological functions with obvious roles in this pathosystem, such as biofilm formation, antibiotic metabolism, pathogenesis, transport, reduction/oxidation, and secretion. Key factors driving the adaptive evolution of this pathogen within the host appear to be the presence of oxidative stressors and antibiotics. Regions of the accessory genome unique to the epidemic strain were enriched for genes in transporter families that efflux heavy metals and antibiotics. The epidemic strain was significantly more resistant than nonepidemic strains to three different antibiotics. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that selection imposed by the CF lung environment has a major influence on genomic evolution and the genetic characteristics of P. aeruginosa isolates causing contemporary infection.	110	52	21065-70	10.1073/pnas.1307862110	Dettman;Rodrigue;Aaron;Kassen	Jeremy R;Nicolas;Shawn D;Rees	Department of Biology, Centre for Advanced Research in Environmental Genomics, and Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada K1N 6N5.	eng	J Antimicrob Chemother. 2005 Jul;56(1):20-51;Science. 2009 Sep 11;325(5946):1380-4;Int J Med Microbiol. 2010 Dec;300(8):549-56;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Oct 17;103(42):15605-10;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2011 Jun 15;183(12):1674-9;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2010 Apr;23(2):299-323;BMC Bioinformatics. 2010;11:595;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;FASEB J. 1998 Mar;12(3):265-74;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2012 Dec;10(12):841-51;Cell. 2007 Sep 7;130(5):797-810;J Bacteriol. 2012 Jun;194(12):3128-36;Mol Ecol. 2012 May;21(9):2058-77;Annu Rev Immunol. 1997;15:323-50;Microbes Infect. 1999 Nov;1(13):1103-12;Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Jan;40(1):e6;Can J Microbiol. 2010 Jul;56(7):548-57;Lancet. 2001 Aug 18;358(9281):558-60;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 May 3;108(18):7481-6;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2002 Oct 1;166(7):983-7;Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2003 Dec;1009:20-9;Science. 2013 Mar 8;339(6124):1210-3;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2009 Sep;7(9):654-65;J Med Microbiol. 2005 Jul;54(Pt 7):667-76;PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e46618;J Bacteriol. 2005 Mar;187(6):2138-47;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jul;187(14):4908-20;J Bacteriol. 2002 Jul;184(13):3614-22;J Clin Microbiol. 2005 Oct;43(10):5085-90;J Bacteriol. 2007 Nov;189(22):8079-87;PLoS One. 2009;4(11):e7740;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;Nat Genet. 2011 Dec;43(12):1275-80;J Appl Physiol (1985). 1993 Dec;75(6):2419-24;JAMA. 2010 Nov 17;304(19):2145-53;Environ Microbiol. 2011 Jul;13(7):1690-704;Mob Genet Elements. 2011 May;1(1):55-65;J Infect Dis. 2009 Jul 1;200(1):118-30;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2011 Jan;24(1):29-70;Thorax. 2004 Apr;59(4):334-6;Infect Immun. 2000 Apr;68(4):1834-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Sep 9;105(36):13586-91;J Infect Dis. 2010 Sep 15;202(6):935-42	MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriol.	1098-5530	Identification of the alternative sigma factor SigX regulon and its implications for Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenicity.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is distinguished by its broad metabolic diversity and its remarkable capability for adaptation, which relies on a large collection of transcriptional regulators and alternative sigma (σ) factors. The largest group of alternative σ factors is that of the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factors, which control key transduction pathways for maintenance of envelope homeostasis in response to external stress and cell growth. In addition, there are specific roles of alternative σ factors in regulating the expression of virulence and virulence-associated genes. Here, we analyzed a deletion mutant of the ECF σ factor SigX and applied mRNA profiling to define the SigX-dependent regulon in P. aeruginosa in response to low-osmolarity-medium conditions. Furthermore, the combination of transcriptional data with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) led to the identification of the DNA binding motif of SigX. Genome-wide mapping of SigX-binding regions revealed enrichment of downstream genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, type III secretion, swarming and cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling. In accordance, a sigX deletion mutant exhibited altered fatty acid composition of the cell membrane, reduced cytotoxicity, impaired swarming activity, elevated c-di-GMP levels, and increased biofilm formation. In conclusion, a combination of ChIP-seq with transcriptional profiling and bioinformatic approaches to define consensus DNA binding sequences proved to be effective for the elucidation of the regulon of the alternative σ factor SigX, revealing its role in complex virulence-associated phenotypes in P. aeruginosa.	196	2	345-56	10.1128/JB.01034-13	Blanka;Schulz;Eckweiler;Franke;Bielecka;Nicolai;Casilag;Düvel;Abraham;Kaever;Häussler	Andrea;Sebastian;Denitsa;Raimo;Agata;Tanja;Fiordiligie;Juliane;Wolf-Rainer;Volkhard;Susanne	Institute for Molecular Bacteriology, Twincore GmbH, Center of Clinical and Experimental Infection Research, Hannover, Germany.	eng	FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2001 Sep 11;203(1):11-21;J Bacteriol. 2001 Dec;183(24):7126-34;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Apr 2;99(7):4632-7;Adv Microb Physiol. 2002;46:47-110;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2002 Nov;52(Pt 6):2191-201;Genome Biol. 2003;4(1):203;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Feb;51(3):675-90;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Feb;51(4):973-85;Mol Microbiol. 2004 May;52(4):1091-105;Infect Genet Evol. 2004 Dec;4(4):301-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 1989 May 11;17(9):3469-78;Gene. 1989 Apr 15;77(1):51-9;Mol Microbiol. 1998 May;28(3):449-61;Gene. 1998 May 28;212(1):77-86;Gene. 1999 Feb 18;227(2):197-203;J Bacteriol. 1999 Aug;181(16):4746-54;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jan 1;33(Database issue):D338-43;Nat Methods. 2005 Jun;2(6):443-8;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2005 Dec;69(4):527-43;J Microbiol Methods. 2006 Mar;64(3):391-7;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2839-44;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007;35(1):269-78;Nat Protoc. 2006;1(1):153-61;J Bacteriol. 2007 May;189(9):3603-12;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Jul;65(1):21-6;J Bacteriol. 2007 Nov;189(22):8165-78;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2008 Jan;32(1):38-55;J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(8):2671-9;Trends Microbiol. 2008 Aug;16(8):388-96;Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 Sep;1778(9):1930-45;Genome Biol. 2008;9(9):R137;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2009 Apr;7(4):263-73;Genome Biol. 2009;10(3):R25;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jul;37(Web Server issue):W202-8;J Bacteriol. 2009 Sep;191(18):5592-602;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Sep;73(6):1072-85;J Virol. 2010 Jan;84(2):964-75;J Microbiol Methods. 2010 Jun;81(3):226-31;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 May 25;107(21):9546-51;Antiviral Res. 2011 Feb;89(2):136-48;Genome Biol. 2010;11(10):R106;Bioinformatics. 2011 Apr 1;27(7):1017-8;Genome Res. 2011 Jun;21(6):936-9;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2011 Aug;77(15):5342-51;Nat Protoc. 2012 Feb;7(2):328-38;PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31092;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2012 Apr;15(2):140-6;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2012 Apr;15(2):182-8;J Bacteriol. 2012 Aug;194(16):4301-11;PLoS Pathog. 2012 Sep;8(9):e1002945;Mol Microbiol. 2013 Feb;87(3):526-38;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2013 Apr;57(4):1617-24;Nature. 2013 Jul 11;499(7457):178-83;Cell Rep. 2013 Aug 29;4(4):697-708	MEDLINE	ppublish

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the composition and richness of bacterial communities associated with low-birthweight (LBW) infants in relation to host body site, individual, and age. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes from saliva samples, skin swabs, and stool samples collected on postnatal days 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, and 21 from six LBW (five premature) infants were amplified, pyrosequenced, and analyzed within a comparative framework that included analogous data from normal-birthweight (NBW) infants and healthy adults. We found that body site was the primary determinant of bacterial community composition in the LBW infants. However, site specificity depended on postnatal age: saliva and stool compositions diverged over time but were not significantly different until the babies were 15 days old. This divergence was primarily driven by progressive temporal turnover in the distal gut, which proceeded at a rate similar to that of age-matched NBW infants. Neonatal skin was the most adult-like in microbiota composition, while saliva and stool remained the least so. Compositional variation among infants was marked and depended on body site and age. Only the smallest, most premature infant received antibiotics during the study period; this heralded a coexpansion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a novel Mycoplasma sp. in the oral cavity of this vaginally delivered, intubated patient. We conclude that concurrent molecular surveillance of multiple body sites in LBW neonates reveals a delayed compositional differentiation of the oral cavity and distal gut microbiota and, in the case of one infant, an abundant, uncultivated oral Mycoplasma sp., recently detected in human vaginal samples.;Complications of premature birth are the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Colonization by the indigenous microbiota, which begins at delivery, may predispose some high-risk newborns to invasive infection or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and protect others, yet neonatal microbiome dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we present the first cultivation-independent time series tracking microbiota assembly across multiple body sites in a synchronous cohort of hospitalized low-birthweight (LBW) neonates. We take advantage of archived samples and publically available sequence data and compare our LBW infant findings to those from normal-birthweight (NBW) infants and healthy adults. Our results suggest potential windows of opportunity for the dispersal of microbes within and between hosts and support recent findings of substantial baseline spatiotemporal variation in microbiota composition among high-risk newborns.	4	6	e00782-13	10.1128/mBio.00782-13	Costello;Carlisle;Bik;Morowitz;Relman	Elizabeth K;Erica M;Elisabeth M;Michael J;David A	Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.	eng	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jan 18;108(3):1128-33;J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2011 Nov;53(5):512-9;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2006 Jul;72(7):5069-72;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Jun 29;107(26):11971-5;Pediatrics. 2006 Aug;118(2):511-21;Pediatr Res. 2004 Sep;56(3):366-70;PLoS Biol. 2007 Jul;5(7):e177;Infection. 1987;15(5):332-6;Acta Paediatr. 2013 Feb;102(2):129-36;Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 Jul 1;34(Web Server issue):W394-9;Science. 2009 Dec 18;326(5960):1694-7;Nat Protoc. 2006;1(2):870-3;J Invest Dermatol. 2011 Oct;131(10):2026-32;N Engl J Med. 2011 Jan 20;364(3):255-64;Nature. 2012 Aug 30;488(7413):621-6;Cell. 2012 Aug 3;150(3):470-80;Am J Perinatol. 2013 Feb;30(2):81-8;J Infect Dis. 2013 Jun 15;207(12):1922-31;ISME J. 2009 Aug;3(8):944-54;Science. 2012 Apr 27;336(6080):489-93;J Perinatol. 2011 Apr;31 Suppl 1:S29-34;J Physiol. 2009 Sep 1;587(Pt 17):4159-67;Bioinformatics. 2011 Aug 15;27(16):2194-200;Microbiome. 2013 Apr 16;1(1):13;J Exp Med. 1965 Jul 1;122:59-66;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2005 Oct;18(4):757-89;Genome Biol. 2011;12(5):R50;Science. 2001 May 11;292(5519):1115-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Mar 15;108 Suppl 1:4578-85;PLoS One. 2010;5(3):e9490;Acta Paediatr. 2012 Nov;101(11):1121-7;Pediatr Infect Dis J. 1992 Jan;11(1):23-9;PLoS One. 2008;3(8):e3056;ISME J. 2010 Aug;4(8):962-74;BMC Med Genomics. 2011;4:22;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1977;31:107-33;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2007 Aug;73(16):5261-7;PLoS One. 2013;8(1):e52876;Nature. 2012 Jun 14;486(7402):222-7;Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed. 2012 Nov;97(6):F456-62;J Pediatr. 2010 Jan;156(1):20-5;Bioinformatics. 2010 Jan 15;26(2):266-7;Nat Methods. 2010 May;7(5):335-6;J Antimicrob Chemother. 1997 Nov;40(5):622-30;J Pediatr Surg. 2011 Mar;46(3):577-84;PLoS One. 2011;6(6):e20647;J Perinatol. 2011 Aug;31(8):519-23;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004;32(4):1363-71;Arch Dis Child. 1992 Jul;67(7 Spec No):797-801;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Dec;71(12):8228-35;Pediatrics. 2012 Feb;129(2):e298-304;Genome Biol. 2010;11(5):210;J Clin Microbiol. 1996 Oct;34(10):2506-10;Bioinformatics. 2010 Oct 1;26(19):2460-1;Nat Methods. 2008 Mar;5(3):235-7;Genome Res. 2013 Jan;23(1):111-20;Syst Biol. 2008 Oct;57(5):758-71;Am J Clin Nutr. 1999 May;69(5):1035S-1045S;Pediatrics. 2002 Aug;110(2 Pt 1):285-91;Nat Rev Immunol. 2007 May;7(5):379-90;Pediatrics. 2010 Apr;125(4):777-85;Nature. 2012 Jun 14;486(7402):207-14	MEDLINE	epublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen particularly associated with the inherited disease cystic fibrosis (CF). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is well known to have a large and adaptable genome that enables it to colonise a wide range of ecological niches. Here, we have used a comparative genomics approach to identify changes that occur during infection of the CF lung. We used the mucoid phenotype as an obvious marker of host adaptation and compared these genomes to analyse SNPs, indels and islands within near-isogenic pairs. To commence the correction of the natural bias towards clinical isolates in genomics studies and to widen our understanding of the genomic diversity of P. aeruginosa, we included four environmental isolates in our analysis. Our data suggest that genome plasticity plays an important role in chronic infection and that the strains sequenced in this study are representative of the two major phylogenetic groups as determined by core genome SNP analysis.	71	1	20-5	10.1111/2049-632X.12107	Stewart;Ford;Sangal;Jeukens;Boyle;Kukavica-Ibrulj;Caim;Crossman;Hoskisson;Levesque;Tucker	Lewis;Amy;Vartul;Julie;Brian;Iréna;Shabhonam;Lisa;Paul A;Roger;Nicholas P	Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Science, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

The potential of bacteriophage therapy to treat infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria has now been well established using various animal models. While numerous newly isolated bacteriophages have been claimed to be potential therapeutic candidates on the basis of in vitro observations, the parameters used to guide their choice among billions of available bacteriophages are still not clearly defined. We made use of a mouse lung infection model and a bioluminescent strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to compare the activities in vitro and in vivo of a set of nine different bacteriophages (PAK_P1, PAK_P2, PAK_P3, PAK_P4, PAK_P5, CHA_P1, LBL3, LUZ19, and PhiKZ). For seven bacteriophages, a good correlation was found between in vitro and in vivo activity. While the remaining two bacteriophages were active in vitro, they were not sufficiently active in vivo under similar conditions to rescue infected animals. Based on the bioluminescence recorded at 2 and 8 h postinfection, we also define for the first time a reliable index to predict treatment efficacy. Our results showed that the bacteriophages isolated directly on the targeted host were the most efficient in vivo, supporting a personalized approach favoring an optimal treatment.	57	12	5961-8	10.1128/AAC.01596-13	Henry;Lavigne;Debarbieux	Marine;Rob;Laurent	Institut Pasteur, Molecular Biology of the Gene in Extremophiles Unit, Department of Microbiology, Paris, France.	eng	Pharm Res. 2011 Apr;28(4):934-7;Nat Biotechnol. 2004 Jan;22(1):31-6;Virology. 2009 Oct 10;393(1):16-23;Res Microbiol. 1991 Jun;142(5):541-9;Clin Pharmacokinet. 2003;42(4):315-25;Infect Immun. 2002 Jan;70(1):204-10;J Biomol Screen. 2007 Sep;12(6):855-64;Virology. 2012 Dec 20;434(2):138-42;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104;Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1993 Oct 15;196(1):416-421;Adv Virus Res. 2012;83:73-121;Bacteriophage. 2011 Mar;1(2):111-114;Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2010 Jan;11(1):69-86;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2001;55:437-51;J Microbiol Methods. 2009 May;77(2):207-13;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Nov;71(11):6554-63;Methods Mol Biol. 2009;502:227-38;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Dec;56(12):6235-42;Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):1844-54;Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2003 Jun;2(6):489-97;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2874-83;PLoS Pathog. 2009 Jan;5(1):e1000253;Trends Biotechnol. 2010 Dec;28(12):591-5;Nat Immunol. 2007 Jan;8(1):3-4;MBio. 2012;3(2):e00029-12;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Feb;56(2):949-54;J Biosci Bioeng. 2005 Sep;100(3):280-7;Adv Virus Res. 2012;83:123-41;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2004 Feb;2(2):166-73;Future Microbiol. 2013 Jun;8(6):769-83;BMC Microbiol. 2002 Nov 26;2:35;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2012 Jun;78(12):4510-5;J Gen Microbiol. 1983 Aug;129(8):2659-75;J Mol Biol. 2002 Mar 15;317(1):1-19;BMC Microbiol. 2012;12:156;Avian Dis. 2010 Mar;54(1):33-40;Clin Infect Dis. 2009 Apr 15;48(8):1096-101;PLoS One. 2011;6(2):e16963;BMC Med. 2011;9:32;Infect Immun. 2002 Nov;70(11):6251-62;J Theor Biol. 2001 Jan 7;208(1):37-48	MEDLINE	ppublish

Genome sequencing of bacterial pathogens has advanced our understanding of their evolution, epidemiology, and response to antibiotic therapy. However, we still have only a limited knowledge of the molecular changes in in vivo evolving bacterial populations in relation to long-term, chronic infections. For example, it remains unclear what genes are mutated to facilitate the establishment of long-term existence in the human host environment, and in which way acquisition of a hypermutator phenotype with enhanced rates of spontaneous mutations influences the evolutionary trajectory of the pathogen. Here we perform a retrospective study of the DK2 clone type of P. aeruginosa isolated from Danish patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF), and analyze the genomes of 55 bacterial isolates collected from 21 infected individuals over 38 years. Our phylogenetic analysis of 8,530 mutations in the DK2 genomes shows that the ancestral DK2 clone type spread among CF patients through several independent transmission events. Subsequent to transmission, sub-lineages evolved independently for years in separate hosts, creating a unique possibility to study parallel evolution and identification of genes targeted by mutations to optimize pathogen fitness (pathoadaptive mutations). These genes were related to antibiotic resistance, the cell envelope, or regulatory functions, and we find that the prevalence of pathoadaptive mutations correlates with evolutionary success of co-evolving sub-lineages. The long-term co-existence of both normal and hypermutator populations enabled comparative investigations of the mutation dynamics in homopolymeric sequences in which hypermutators are particularly prone to mutations. We find a positive exponential correlation between the length of the homopolymer and its likelihood to acquire mutations and identify two homopolymer-containing genes preferentially mutated in hypermutators. This homopolymer facilitated differential mutagenesis provides a novel genome-wide perspective on the different evolutionary trajectories of hypermutators, which may help explain their emergence in CF infections.	9	9	e1003741	10.1371/journal.pgen.1003741	Marvig;Johansen;Molin;Jelsbak	Rasmus Lykke;Helle Krogh;Søren;Lars	Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.	eng	Trends Microbiol. 1999 May;7(5):191-5;Clin Infect Dis. 1998 Aug;27 Suppl 1:S93-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8305-6;Mutat Res. 2006 Jun 25;598(1-2):144-63;Bioessays. 2007 Sep;29(9):846-60;J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(8):2767-76;J Clin Microbiol. 2008 Oct;46(10):3491-3;Pediatr Pulmonol. 2009 Aug;44(8):820-5;Bioinformatics. 2009 Aug 15;25(16):2078-9;J Med Microbiol. 2009 Sep;58(Pt 9):1133-48;PLoS One. 2009;4(12):e8203;Science. 2010 Jan 22;327(5964):469-74;Bioinformatics. 2010 Mar 15;26(6):722-9;Nat Genet. 2010 Dec;42(12):1140-3;Science. 2011 Jan 28;331(6016):430-4;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 May 3;108(18):7481-6;Nature. 2011 Sep 22;477(7365):462-5;Nat Genet. 2011 Dec;43(12):1275-80;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Feb;56(2):1019-30;Nat Genet. 2012 Apr;44(4):413-9, S1;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Aug;56(8):4519-21;Environ Microbiol. 2012 Aug;14(8):2200-11;Mol Biol Evol. 2012 Aug;29(8):1969-73;J Bacteriol. 2012 Sep;194(18):4857-66;Nat Genet. 2012 Sep;44(9):1056-9;Chembiochem. 2012 Nov 5;13(16):2339-45;Science. 2000 May 19;288(5469):1251-4;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Mar;43(6):1641-50;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Apr 30;99(9):6103-7;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2003 Jan;47(1):95-101;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):575-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 1987 Jul 10;15(13):5323-38;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Sep;84(17):6220-4;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Oct 1;89(19):8938-42;Nature. 1993 Sep 16;365(6443):274-6;Curr Biol. 1994 Jan 1;4(1):24-33;J Biol Chem. 1995 Oct 13;270(41):23926-9;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1995 Aug;39(8):1871-4;J Antimicrob Chemother. 1996 Jul;38(1):133-7;Science. 1996 Nov 15;274(5290):1208-11;J Bacteriol. 1997 Jan;179(2):417-22;Nature. 1997 Jun 12;387(6634):703-5;Science. 1997 Sep 19;277(5333):1833-4;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Jun;49(6):2276-82	MEDLINE	ppublish

B. cenocepacia is an opportunistic human pathogen that is particularly problematic for patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). In the CF lung bacteria grow to high densities within the viscous mucus that is limited in oxygen. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the dominant pathogen in CF patients, is known to grow and survive under oxygen-limited to anaerobic conditions by using micro-oxic respiration, denitrification and fermentative pathways. In contrast, inspection of the genome sequences of available B. cenocepacia strains suggested that B. cenocepacia is an obligate aerobic and non-fermenting bacterium. In accordance with the bioinformatics analysis we observed that B. cenocepacia H111 is able to grow with as little as 0.1% O2 but not under strictly anoxic conditions. Phenotypic analyses revealed that H111 produced larger amounts of biofilm, pellicle and proteases under micro-oxic conditions (0.5%-5% O2, i.e. conditions that mimic those encountered in CF lung infection), and was more resistant to several antibiotics. RNA-Seq and shotgun proteomics analyses of cultures of B. cenocepacia H111 grown under micro-oxic and aerobic conditions showed up-regulation of genes involved in the synthesis of the exopolysaccharide (EPS) cepacian as well as several proteases, two isocitrate lyases and other genes potentially important for life in micro-oxia.;RNA-Seq raw data files are accessible through the GEO Series accession number GSE48585.

The alarming rise of ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported in several clinical studies. Though the mutation of resistance genes and their role in drug resistance has been researched, the process by which the bacterium acquires high-level resistance is still not well understood. How does the genomic evolution of P. aeruginosa affect resistance development? Could the exposure of antibiotics to the bacteria enrich genomic variants that lead to the development of resistance, and if so, how are these variants distributed through the genome? To answer these questions, we performed 454 pyrosequencing and a whole genome analysis both before and after exposure to ciprofloxacin. The comparative sequence data revealed 93 unique resistance strain variation sites, which included a mutation in the DNA gyrase subunit A gene. We generated variation-distribution maps comparing the wild and resistant types, and isolated 19 candidates from three discrete resistance-associated high variability regions that had available transposon mutants, to perform a ciprofloxacin exposure assay. Of these region candidates with transposon disruptions, 79% (15/19) showed a reduction in the ability to gain high-level resistance, suggesting that genes within these high variability regions might enrich for certain functions associated with resistance development.	19	6	428-36	10.1089/mdr.2012.0258	Su;Khatun;Kanavy;Giddings	Hsun-Cheng;Jainab;Dona M;Morgan C	1 Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, UNC School of Medicine , Chapel Hill, North Carolina.	eng	Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1994 Sep;38(9):1944-52;Anal Biochem. 1988 Nov 1;174(2):423-36;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1999 Jan;43(1):62-6;Nat Med. 2004 Dec;10(12 Suppl):S122-9;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2005 Mar;25(3):193-7;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Aug;49(8):3222-7;Nature. 2005 Sep 15;437(7057):376-80;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007 Apr;51(4):1341-50;Genome Res. 2007 Aug;17(8):1195-201;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):763-70;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2008 Dec;52(12):4486-91;Curr Opin Drug Discov Devel. 2010 May;13(3):297-309;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Nov;54(11):4626-35;PLoS One. 2010;5(12):e14220;MBio. 2011;2(1):e00315-10;PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e26745;Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Jan;40(1):e2;Genome Biol Evol. 2012;4(4):457-65;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2000 Mar;44(3):710-2;Nature. 2000 Aug 17;406(6797):775-81;Clin Infect Dis. 2000 Aug;31 Suppl 2:S24-8;Genome Res. 2001 Jan;11(1):3-11;Clin Infect Dis. 2001 Mar 15;32 Suppl 1:S9-S15;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Aug;45(8):2263-8;J Bacteriol. 2003 Feb;185(4):1316-25;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2003 Mar;47(3):948-55;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2003 May;21(5):409-13;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Nov 25;100(24):14339-44;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1995 Sep;39(9):1970-2	MEDLINE	ppublish

Agents Chemother.	1098-6596	Complete sequence of pOZ176, a 500-kilobase IncP-2 plasmid encoding IMP-9-mediated carbapenem resistance, from outbreak isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa 96.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa 96 (PA96) was isolated during a multicenter surveillance study in Guangzhou, China, in 2000. Whole-genome sequencing of this outbreak strain facilitated analysis of its IncP-2 carbapenem-resistant plasmid, pOZ176. The plasmid had a length of 500,839 bp and an average percent G+C content of 57%. Of the 618 predicted open reading frames, 65% encode hypothetical proteins. The pOZ176 backbone is not closely related to any plasmids thus far sequenced, but some similarity to pQBR103 of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 was observed. Two multiresistant class 1 integrons and several insertion sequences were identified. The blaIMP-9-carrying integron contained aacA4 → bla(IMP-9) → aacA4, flanked upstream by Tn21 tnpMRA and downstream by a complete tni operon of Tn402 and a mer module, named Tn6016. The second integron carried aacA4 → catB8a → bla(OXA-10) and was flanked by Tn1403-like tnpRA and a sul1-type 3' conserved sequence (3'-CS), named Tn6217. Other features include three resistance genes similar to those of Tn5, a tellurite resistance operon, and two pil operons. The replication and maintenance systems exhibit similarity to a genomic island of Ralstonia solanacearum GM1000. Codon usage analysis suggests the recent acquisition of bla(IMP-9). The origins of the integrons on pOZ176 indicated separate horizontal gene transfer events driven by antibiotic selection. The novel mosaic structure of pOZ176 suggests that it is derived from environmental bacteria.	57	8	3775-82	10.1128/AAC.00423-13	Xiong;Alexander;Ma;Déraspe;Low;Jamieson;Roy	Jianhui;David C;Jennifer H;Maxime;Donald E;Frances B;Paul H	Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.	eng	Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2000 Apr;44(4):891-7;J Bacteriol. 2012 Dec;194(23):6642-3;Mol Microbiol. 2000 Aug;37(3):467-76;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2001 Jan 1;194(1):53-7;Res Microbiol. 2001 Nov;152(9):811-22;Nature. 2002 Jan 31;415(6871):497-502;Microbiology. 2002 Nov;148(Pt 11):3569-82;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):856-71;Genome Res. 2004 Jul;14(7):1394-403;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1976 Oct;10(4):573-8;Gene. 1977 May;1(3-4):241-53;Plasmid. 1979 Jan;2(1):41-7;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1983 Aug;24(2):168-75;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1983 Sep;24(3):362-9;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1988 Jan;32(1):134-6;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1989 Dec;33(12):2052-62;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1991 Jan;35(1):147-51;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1994 Jan;38(1):71-8;J Bacteriol. 1994 Jun;176(11):3257-68;J Mol Biol. 1994 Jun 24;239(5):623-63;Microbiology. 1997 Aug;143 ( Pt 8):2549-56;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1997 Nov;63(11):4494-503;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1998 Aug 15;165(2):253-60;J Mol Biol. 1998 Oct 9;282(5):969-90;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1999 Apr;43(4):890-901;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1999 Jul;43(7):1584-90;Bioinformatics. 2005 Feb 15;21(4):537-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W455-9;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jul;187(14):4728-38;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Aug;49(8):3538-40;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006 Jan;50(1):355-8;J Clin Microbiol. 2006 Jul;44(7):2348-53;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007 May;51(5):1827-9;J Mol Biol. 2007 May 25;369(1):11-26;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007 Sep;51(9):3467-8;ISME J. 2007 Aug;1(4):331-40;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:75;Genomics. 2008 Jun;91(6):530-7;Bioinformatics. 2008 Dec 1;24(23):2672-6;J Bacteriol. 2009 Jul;191(14):4534-45;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Jan;54(1):320-7;PLoS One. 2010;5(1):e8842;Bioinformatics. 2010 Feb 1;26(3):401-2;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010 Mar;65(3):474-8;BMC Bioinformatics. 2010;11:119;J Bacteriol. 2010 Sep;192(17):4337-47;J Clin Microbiol. 2011 Mar;49(3):993-1003;J Bacteriol. 2011 Jun;193(11):2735-44;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 Jun;55(6):2937-41;Plasmid. 2011 Oct;66(1):7-18;Mol Biol Evol. 2011 Oct;28(10):2731-9;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2012;66:493-520;Res Microbiol. 2000 May;151(4):291-302	MEDLINE	ppublish

We isolated and characterized a new Pseudomonas aeruginosa myovirus named PaP1. The morphology of this phage was visualized by electron microscopy and its genome sequence and ends were determined. Finally, genomic and proteomic analyses were performed. PaP1 has an icosahedral head with an apex diameter of 68-70 nm and a contractile tail with a length of 138-140 nm. The PaP1 genome is a linear dsDNA molecule containing 91,715 base pairs (bp) with a G+C content of 49.36% and 12 tRNA genes. A strategy to identify the genome ends of PaP1 was designed. The genome has a 1190 bp terminal redundancy. PaP1 has 157 open reading frames (ORFs). Of these, 143 proteins are homologs of known proteins, but only 38 could be functionally identified. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry allowed identification of 12 ORFs as structural protein coding genes within the PaP1 genome. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage PaP1, JG004, PAK_P1 and vB_PaeM_C2-10_Ab1 share great similarity. Besides their similar biological characteristics, the phages contain 123 core genes and have very close phylogenetic relationships, which distinguish them from other known phage genera. We therefore propose that these four phages be classified as PaP1-like phages, a new phage genus of Myoviridae that infects Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	8	5	e62933	10.1371/journal.pone.0062933	Lu;Le;Tan;Zhu;Li;Rao;Zou;Li;Wang;Jin;Huang;Zhang;Zhao;Hu	Shuguang;Shuai;Yinling;Junmin;Ming;Xiancai;Lingyun;Shu;Jing;Xiaolin;Guangtao;Lin;Xia;Fuquan	Department of Microbiology, College of Basic Medical Science, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.	eng	Int J Comput Biol Drug Des. 2009;2(1):100-14;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2874-83;Future Microbiol. 2010 Jul;5(7):1041-55;J Bacteriol. 2010 Oct;192(19):4885-93;BMC Microbiol. 2010;10:301;PLoS One. 2011;6(2):e16963;BMC Microbiol. 2011;11:102;Nat Protoc. 2011 Sep;6(9):1367-76;Mol Biol Evol. 2011 Oct;28(10):2731-9;Adv Appl Microbiol. 2011;77:1-40;MBio. 2012;3(2):e00029-12;Arch Virol. 2012 Apr;157(4):733-8;Genome Res. 2012 Apr;22(4):802-9;BMC Microbiol. 2012;12:54;PLoS One. 2012;7(7):e41967;Arch Virol. 2012 Oct;157(10):1843-9;J Bacteriol. 2001 Mar;183(6):1928-37;Comput Chem. 2001 Dec;26(1):51-6;J Mol Biol. 2002 Mar 15;317(1):1-19;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jan 1;31(1):28-33;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jul 1;31(13):3497-500;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2003 Oct;6(5):506-11;BMC Bioinformatics. 2002 Apr 24;3:12;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Feb;51(4):1169-83;J Mol Biol. 1971 May 14;57(3):491-511;J Biol Chem. 1985 Jun 10;260(11):6999-7007;Nucleic Acids Res. 1990 May 25;18(10):2881-6;J Gen Virol. 1990 Sep;71 ( Pt 9):2157-62;J Mol Biol. 1997 Mar 28;267(2):237-49;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Virology. 1998 Jul 5;246(2):329-40;Mol Microbiol. 1999 Jan;31(2):399-419;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Mar 2;96(5):2192-7;Virus Res. 1999 Mar;60(1):1-19;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Oct 1;27(19):3911-20;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W686-9;J Mol Biol. 2005 Dec 2;354(3):536-45;Curr Opin Struct Biol. 2005 Dec;15(6):655-63;Int J Med Microbiol. 2006 Feb;296(1):5-14;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(3):1184-7;J Bacteriol. 2006 Apr;188(7):2568-77;Clin Infect Dis. 2006 Sep 1;43 Suppl 2:S49-56;Proteomics. 2007 Jan;7(1):64-72;Cell Microbiol. 2007 Feb;9(2):479-91;Methods Enzymol. 2007;421:259-68;Bioinformatics. 2007 Apr 15;23(8):1026-8;J Virol. 2007 Jul;81(14):7662-71;J Mass Spectrom. 2007 Aug;42(8):1062-8;Virology. 2007 Sep 1;365(2):241-9;Curr Protoc Bioinformatics. 2007 Mar;Chapter 11:Unit11.4;Virology. 2008 Aug 1;377(2):233-8;J Bacteriol. 2008 Sep;190(17):5753-65;Med Mal Infect. 2008 Aug;38(8):421-5;Int Immunopharmacol. 2008 Dec 10;8(12):1622-5;Bioinformatics. 2008 Dec 1;24(23):2672-6;J Biotechnol. 2009 Jan 1;139(1):118-23;Bioinformatics. 2009 Jan 1;25(1):119-20;Mol Phylogenet Evol. 2009 Sep;52(3):846-51;Mol Ecol. 2009 Nov;18(21):4434-49;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104	MEDLINE	epublish

Phage therapy may become a complement to antibiotics in the treatment of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. To design efficient therapeutic cocktails, the genetic diversity of the species and the spectrum of susceptibility to bacteriophages must be investigated. Bacterial strains showing high levels of phage resistance need to be identified in order to decipher the underlying mechanisms. Here we have selected genetically diverse P. aeruginosa strains from cystic fibrosis patients and tested their susceptibility to a large collection of phages. Based on plaque morphology and restriction profiles, six different phages were purified from pyophage, a commercial cocktail directed against five different bacterial species, including P. aeruginosa. Characterization of these phages by electron microscopy and sequencing of genome fragments showed that they belong to 4 different genera. Among 47 P. aeruginosa strains, 13 were not lysed by any of the isolated phages individually or by pyophage. We isolated two new phages that could lyse some of these strains, and their genomes were sequenced. The presence/absence of a CRISPR-Cas system (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and Crisper associated genes) was investigated to evaluate the role of the system in phage resistance. Altogether, the results show that some P. aeruginosa strains cannot support the growth of any of the tested phages belonging to 5 different genera, and suggest that the CRISPR-Cas system is not a major defence mechanism against these lytic phages.	8	4	e60575	10.1371/journal.pone.0060575	Essoh;Blouin;Loukou;Cablanmian;Lathro;Kutter;Thien;Vergnaud;Pourcel	Christiane;Yann;Guillaume;Arsher;Serge;Elizabeth;Hoang Vu;Gilles;Christine	Univ Paris-Sud, Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie, UMR 8621, Orsay, France ; CNRS, Orsay, France.	eng	Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2012 Sep;31(9):2247-56;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2010 May;8(5):317-27;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Jul 15;89(14):6658-62;Pharm Res. 2011 Apr;28(4):934-7;Virology. 2008 Aug 1;377(2):233-8;Microbiology. 2011 Feb;157(Pt 2):430-7;Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2012 Nov;31(11):3241-9;Methods Mol Biol. 2009;501:141-9;Med Mal Infect. 2008 Aug;38(8):426-30;Adv Virus Res. 2012;83:3-40;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2010 Apr;23(2):299-323;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2000 Apr 15;185(2):99-107;Proc Biol Sci. 2012 May 22;279(1735):1896-903;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2008 Mar;6(3):181-6;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104;J Bacteriol. 2004 Dec;186(24):8287-94;Adv Virus Res. 2012;83:73-121;Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2010 Jan;11(1):69-86;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):821-9;BMC Microbiol. 2011;11:102;PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e51163;Future Microbiol. 2010 Jul;5(7):1041-55;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jul 1;36(Web Server issue):W145-8;Nature. 2013 Jan 17;493(7432):429-32;Bioessays. 2011 Jan;33(1):43-51;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2775-7;Science. 1995 Jun 30;268(5219):1899-902;J Bacteriol. 2012 Nov;194(21):5728-38;Virol J. 2010;7:290;Plant Cell. 2004 Sep;16(9):2265-77;J Clin Microbiol. 2007 Oct;45(10):3175-83;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;Genetika. 2008 Feb;44(2):185-94;Bacteriophage. 2011 Mar;1(2):66-85;Cell Microbiol. 2007 Feb;9(2):479-91;Bacteriol Rev. 1969 Sep;33(3):419-43;Viruses. 2010 Mar;2(3):710-30;Science. 2007 Mar 23;315(5819):1709-12;J Bacteriol. 2010 Dec;192(23):6291-4;J Med Microbiol. 2004 Jul;53(Pt 7):609-15;Virology. 2008 Jul 5;376(2):330-8;MBio. 2012;3(2):e00029-12;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Jul;35(Web Server issue):W52-7;J Comput Biol. 2010 Nov;17(11):1519-33;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2012 Jun;94(6):1609-17;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(3):1184-7;Adv Appl Microbiol. 2012;78:1-23;J Clin Microbiol. 1984 May;19(5):717-9;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2011 Jun;9(6):467-77;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 24;101(8):2530-5;Microbiology. 2005 Mar;151(Pt 3):653-63;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1994 Jun;60(6):1734-8;Res Microbiol. 2003 May;154(4):269-75;PLoS One. 2011;6(2):e16963;Adv Appl Microbiol. 2010;70:217-48;Infect Immun. 1982 Apr;36(1):440-1;MBio. 2012;3(2). pii: e00061-12. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00061-12;J Mol Biol. 2003 Jul 18;330(4):735-48;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Dec;56(12):6175-80;Respir Care. 2009 May;54(5):628-40;Biol Direct. 2011;6:38;J Appl Microbiol. 1998 Sep;85(3):583-90	MEDLINE	epublish

Aeromonas hydrophila has increasingly been implicated as a virulent and antibiotic-resistant etiologic agent in various human diseases. In a previously published case report, we described a subject with a polymicrobial wound infection that included a persistent and aggressive strain of A. hydrophila (E1), as well as a more antibiotic-resistant strain of A. hydrophila (E2). To better understand the differences between pathogenic and environmental strains of A. hydrophila, we conducted comparative genomic and functional analyses of virulence-associated genes of these two wound isolates (E1 and E2), the environmental type strain A. hydrophila ATCC 7966(T), and four other isolates belonging to A. aquariorum, A. veronii, A. salmonicida, and A. caviae. Full-genome sequencing of strains E1 and E2 revealed extensive differences between the two and strain ATCC 7966(T). The more persistent wound infection strain, E1, harbored coding sequences for a cytotoxic enterotoxin (Act), a type 3 secretion system (T3SS), flagella, hemolysins, and a homolog of exotoxin A found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Corresponding phenotypic analyses with A. hydrophila ATCC 7966(T) and SSU as reference strains demonstrated the functionality of these virulence genes, with strain E1 displaying enhanced swimming and swarming motility, lateral flagella on electron microscopy, the presence of T3SS effector AexU, and enhanced lethality in a mouse model of Aeromonas infection. By combining sequence-based analysis and functional assays, we characterized an A. hydrophila pathotype, exemplified by strain E1, that exhibited increased virulence in a mouse model of infection, likely because of encapsulation, enhanced motility, toxin secretion, and cellular toxicity.;Aeromonas hydrophila is a common aquatic bacterium that has increasingly been implicated in serious human infections. While many determinants of virulence have been identified in Aeromonas, rapid identification of pathogenic versus nonpathogenic strains remains a challenge for this genus, as it is for other opportunistic pathogens. This paper demonstrates, by using whole-genome sequencing of clinical Aeromonas strains, followed by corresponding virulence assays, that comparative genomics can be used to identify a virulent subtype of A. hydrophila that is aggressive during human infection and more lethal in a mouse model of infection. This aggressive pathotype contained genes for toxin production, toxin secretion, and bacterial motility that likely enabled its pathogenicity. Our results highlight the potential of whole-genome sequencing to transform microbial diagnostics; with further advances in rapid sequencing and annotation, genomic analysis will be able to provide timely information on the identities and virulence potential of clinically isolated microorganisms.	4	2	e00064-13	10.1128/mBio.00064-13	Grim;Kozlova;Sha;Fitts;van Lier;Kirtley;Joseph;Read;Burd;Tall;Joseph;Horneman;Chopra;Shak	Christopher J;Elena V;Jian;Eric C;Christina J;Michelle L;Sandeep J;Timothy D;Eileen M;Ben D;Sam W;Amy J;Ashok K;Joshua R	Food and Drug Administration, Laurel, Maryland, USA.	eng	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Aug 26;105(34):12497-502;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:427;Microb Pathog. 2008 Nov-Dec;45(5-6):343-54;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2009 Feb;12(1):11-7;Braz J Infect Dis. 2008 Dec;12(6):547-8;Microbiology. 2009 Nov;155(Pt 11):3518-31;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Nov 10;106(45):19126-31;J Bacteriol. 2010 Jan;192(1):155-68;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2010 Jan;23(1):35-73;Microb Pathog. 2010 Sep;49(3):122-34;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2010 Sep;8(9):634-44;J Appl Microbiol. 2010 Jul;109(1):212-9;J Infect. 2011 Feb;62(2):109-18;J Bacteriol. 2011 Mar;193(5):1286-7;J Clin Microbiol. 2011 Mar;49(3):1169-70;Microb Pathog. 2011 May;50(5):213-23;Cell Host Microbe. 2011 Apr 21;9(4):263-72;J Immunol. 2011 Jun 1;186(11):6585-96;J Bacteriol. 2011 Jul;193(13):3389-90;J Trauma. 2011 Aug;71(2):467-73; discussion 473;Vet Microbiol. 2011 Sep 28;152(3-4):353-60;Mol Biol Evol. 2011 Oct;28(10):2731-9;Microbiology. 2012 Jan;158(Pt 1):259-71;PLoS One. 2012;7(3):e33725;J Bacteriol. 2012 Aug;194(15):4114-5;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2012 Sep;67(9):2069-89;Microb Pathog. 2012 Sep;53(3-4):115-24;Infect Immun. 2000 May;68(5):2808-18;Microbes Infect. 1999 Nov;1(13):1129-37;Infect Immun. 2001 Oct;69(10):6370-81;J Bacteriol. 2002 Jan;184(2):547-55;Infect Immun. 2002 Apr;70(4):1799-806;Infect Immun. 2002 Apr;70(4):1924-35;Infect Immun. 2002 May;70(5):2326-35;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Jan;4(1):18-28;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Jan;43(2):383-97;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2002;56:289-314;J Bacteriol. 2004 Feb;186(3):889-93;Infect Immun. 2004 Mar;72(3):1248-56;J Biol Chem. 2004 Sep 3;279(36):37597-612;J Clin Microbiol. 1979 Jul;10(1):46-9;J Clin Microbiol. 1981 Apr;13(4):769-77;Pharmacol Ther. 1981;15(3):339-54;Lancet. 1982 Dec 11;2(8311):1304-6;Infect Immun. 1985 Apr;48(1):146-52;Infect Immun. 1985 Oct;50(1):62-5;J Gen Microbiol. 1986 Jul;132(7):1975-9;Infect Immun. 1988 Oct;56(10):2639-44;J Clin Microbiol. 1991 Mar;29(3):565-9;J Clin Microbiol. 1991 Dec;29(12):2843-9;Can J Microbiol. 1993 May;39(5):513-23;Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 1995 Jan;14(1):51-3;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1997 Jun 15;151(2):213-7;J Bacteriol. 1997 Sep;179(17):5271-81;Infect Immun. 1997 Oct;65(10):4299-308;Microbiology. 1997 Dec;143 ( Pt 12):3703-11;Mol Microbiol. 1998 May;28(3):449-61;Clin Infect Dis. 1998 Aug;27(2):332-44;Science. 1999 May 21;284(5418):1318-22;Infect Immun. 1999 Oct;67(10):5192-9;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Feb;55(4):1160-82;Bioinformatics. 2005 Aug 15;21(16):3422-3;Nature. 2005 Sep 15;437(7057):376-80;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005;33(17):5691-702;Infect Immun. 2006 Jan;74(1):410-24;Pediatr Emerg Care. 2006 Jan;22(1):48-51;J Med Microbiol. 2006 Feb;55(Pt 2):241-3;J Bacteriol. 2006 Dec;188(23):8272-82;Can J Microbiol. 2007 Feb;53(2):261-9;Microb Pathog. 2007 Oct;43(4):147-60;Microb Pathog. 2007 Oct;43(4):127-46;Cell Microbiol. 2007 Sep;9(9):2103-11;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2007 Oct;275(2):301-11;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2007 Oct;73(20):6339-44;BMC Microbiol. 2007;7:93;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:75	MEDLINE	epublish

Ecol.	1574-6941	Phosphate limitation induces the intergeneric inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by Serratia marcescens isolated from paper machines.	Phosphate is an essential nutrient for heterotrophic bacteria, affecting bacterioplankton in aquatic ecosystems and bacteria in biofilms. However, the influence of phosphate limitation on bacterial competition and biofilm development in multispecies populations has received limited attention in existing studies. To address this issue, we isolated 13 adhesive bacteria from paper machine aggregates. Intergeneric inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa WW5 by Serratia marcescens WW4 was identified under phosphate-limited conditions, but not in Luria-Bertani medium or M9 minimal medium. The viable numbers of the pure S. marcescens WW4 culture decreased over 3 days in the phosphate-limited medium; however, the mortality of S. marcescens WW4 was significantly reduced when it was co-cultured with P. aeruginosa WW5, which appeared to sustain the S. marcescens WW4 biofilm. In contrast, viable P. aeruginosa WW5 cells immediately declined in the phosphate-limited co-culture. To identify the genetic/inhibitory element(s) involved in this process, we inserted a mini-Tn5 mutant of S. marcescens WW4 that lacked inhibitory effect. The results showed that an endonuclease bacteriocin was involved in this intergeneric inhibition by S. marcescens WW4 under phosphate limitation. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of nutrient limitation in bacterial interactions and provides a strong candidate gene for future functional characterisation.	84	3	577-87	10.1111/1574-6941.12086	Kuo;Kuo;Lai;Graumann;Tu	Pei-An;Chih-Horng;Yiu-Kay;Peter L;Jenn	Institute of Microbiology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.	eng	J Appl Microbiol. 2004;96(3):455-63;J Bacteriol. 1990 Nov;172(11):6568-72;Exp Parasitol. 2007 Oct;117(2):201-7;Exp Parasitol. 2008 Apr;118(4):561-8;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2010 Jan;8(1):15-25;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1998 Jun 15;163(2):193-202;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Mar 7;103(10):3828-33;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2010 Jan;302(1):22-31;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2007 Aug;73(15):4966-74;J Appl Microbiol. 1998 Jun;84(6):1069-84;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2002;56:117-37;J Bacteriol. 1991 Jan;173(2):697-703;J Bacteriol. 1993 May;175(10):2907-16;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1994 Feb;60(2):434-46;ISME J. 2011 Jan;5(1):71-81;Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2010 Dec;51(12):6329-33;BMC Bioinformatics. 2009;10:421;Int J Med Microbiol. 2006 Apr;296(2-3):117-24;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 Feb;74(4):1259-63;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2009 Apr;12(2):205-14;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2008 Jun;283(1):83-90;FEMS Microbiol Ecol. 2003 Dec 1;46(3):307-16;Microb Ecol. 1997 Jan;33(1):2-10;J Bacteriol. 2005 May;187(10):3477-85;J Microbiol Methods. 1999 Mar;35(2):163-6;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2007 Mar;71(1):158-229;Microb Ecol. 2006 Aug;52(2):358-64;Biochimie. 2002 May-Jun;84(5-6):499-510;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Oct;71(10):5828-36;J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol. 2001 Dec;27(6):343-51;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Oct;42(2):415-26;Comput Chem. 2001 Dec;26(1):51-6;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2007 Jul;31(4):407-24;J Bacteriol. 1998 Apr;180(8):2262-4;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1991 Jul;57(7):1974-9	MEDLINE	ppublish

A widespread system used by bacteria for protection against potentially dangerous foreign DNA molecules consists of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) coupled with cas (CRISPR-associated) genes. Similar to RNA interference in eukaryotes, these CRISPR/Cas systems use small RNAs for sequence-specific detection and neutralization of invading genomes. Here we describe the first examples of genes that mediate the inhibition of a CRISPR/Cas system. Five distinct 'anti-CRISPR' genes were found in the genomes of bacteriophages infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mutation of the anti-CRISPR gene of a phage rendered it unable to infect bacteria with a functional CRISPR/Cas system, and the addition of the same gene to the genome of a CRISPR/Cas-targeted phage allowed it to evade the CRISPR/Cas system. Phage-encoded anti-CRISPR genes may represent a widespread mechanism for phages to overcome the highly prevalent CRISPR/Cas systems. The existence of anti-CRISPR genes presents new avenues for the elucidation of CRISPR/Cas functional mechanisms and provides new insight into the co-evolution of phages and bacteria.	493	7432	429-32	10.1038/nature11723	Bondy-Denomy;Pawluk;Maxwell;Davidson	Joe;April;Karen L;Alan R	Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.	eng	Nat Rev Microbiol. 2010 May;8(5):317-27;Nature. 2011 Sep 21;477(7365):486-9;Microbiology. 2011 Feb;157(Pt 2):430-7;Science. 2010 Sep 10;329(5997):1355-8;Nature. 2011 Mar 31;471(7340):602-7;Microbiology. 2007 Sep;153(Pt 9):2885-95;J Mol Biol. 2002 Mar 29;317(3):337-59;Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2012 Jun 01;4(6):null;J Bacteriol. 2008 Nov;190(21):7130-40;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jun 21;108(25):10098-103;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):400-10;Biol Direct. 2006 Mar 16;1:7;Nat Commun. 2012 Jul 10;3:945;J Bacteriol. 2009 Jan;191(1):210-9;Nature. 2010 Jan 28;463(7280):568-71;J Bacteriol. 2012 Nov;194(21):5728-38;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2009 Nov;7(11):828-36;Microbiology. 2009 Mar;155(Pt 3):733-40;J Virol. 2012 Aug;86(15):8336;BMC Genomics. 2008 Feb 08;9:75;Science. 2007 Mar 23;315(5819):1709-12;J Bacteriol. 2004 Oct;186(19):6560-74;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jun 21;108(25):10092-7;Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Jul;40(12):5569-76;Science. 2008 Aug 15;321(5891):960-4;Nature. 2010 Nov 4;468(7320):67-71;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2011 Jun;9(6):467-77;J Bacteriol. 2011 Jul;193(14):3433-45;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 Dec;74(23):7422-6;Bioinformatics. 2007 Nov 1;23(21):2947-8;Mol Cell. 2012 Jun 8;46(5):595-605	MEDLINE	ppublish
245	23236447	2012				Print-Electronic	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	PloS one	PLoS ONE	1932-6203	Genomic analysis of Pseudomonas putida phage tf with localized single-strand DNA interruptions.	The complete sequence of the 46,267 bp genome of the lytic bacteriophage tf specific to Pseudomonas putida PpG1 has been determined. The phage genome has two sets of convergently transcribed genes and 186 bp long direct terminal repeats. The overall genomic architecture of the tf phage is similar to that of the previously described Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages PaP3, LUZ24 and phiMR299-2, and 39 out of the 72 products of predicted tf open reading frames have orthologs in these phages. Accordingly, tf was classified as belonging to the LUZ24-like bacteriophage group. However, taking into account very low homology levels between tf DNA and that of the other phages, tf should be considered as an evolutionary divergent member of the group. Two distinguishing features not reported for other members of the group were found in the tf genome. Firstly, a unique end structure--a blunt right end and a 4-nucleotide 3'-protruding left end--was observed. Secondly, 14 single-chain interruptions (nicks) were found in the top strand of the tf DNA. All nicks were mapped within a consensus sequence 5'-TACT/RTGMC-3'. Two nicks were analyzed in detail and were shown to be present in more than 90% of the phage population. Although localized nicks were previously found only in the DNA of T5-like and phiKMV-like phages, it seems increasingly likely that this enigmatic structural feature is common to various other bacteriophages.	7	12	e51163	10.1371/journal.pone.0051163	Glukhov;Krutilina;Shlyapnikov;Severinov;Lavysh;Kochetkov;McGrath;de Leeuwe;Shaburova;Krylov;Akulenko;Kulakov	Anatoly S;Antonina I;Michael G;Konstantin;Daria;Vladimir V;John W;Colin;Olga V;Victor N;Natalia V;Leonid A	Institute of Protein Research, Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino, Russia.	eng	Mol Biol (Mosk). 2000 Mar-Apr;34(2):253-62;MBio. 2012;3(2):e00029-12;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2003 May;69(5):2491-7;Virology. 2003 Jul 5;311(2):305-15;J Bacteriol. 1966 Dec;92(6):1821-7;J Mol Biol. 1971 Dec 28;62(3):551-64;J Virol. 1977 May;22(2):510-9;J Virol. 1979 Jan;29(1):220-31;J Virol. 1979 Feb;29(2):716-25;Genetika. 1981;17(10):1737-44;J Virol. 1984 Aug;51(2):553-5;J Mol Biol. 1985 Jan 20;181(2):187-97;Mol Gen Genet. 1985;200(1):123-7;Mol Gen Mikrobiol Virusol. 1988 Jun;(6):12-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 1988 Oct 25;16(20):9677-86;J Mol Biol. 1990 Jun 20;213(4):811-8;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;Nucleic Acids Res. 1994 Nov 11;22(22):4673-80;J Mol Biol. 1998 Nov 27;284(2):241-54;Virology. 1999 Mar 1;255(1):63-76;Virology. 2005 Feb 5;332(1):45-65;J Bacteriol. 2006 Oct;188(19):6924-31;Cell Microbiol. 2007 Feb;9(2):479-91;J Bacteriol. 2007 Nov;189(22):8290-9;J Mol Biol. 2008 Mar 28;377(3):774-89;Virology. 2008 Aug 1;377(2):233-8;Res Microbiol. 2008 Jun;159(5):406-14;Methods Mol Biol. 2009;502:91-111;Virology. 2009 Aug 15;391(1):1-4;Environ Microbiol. 2011 May;13(5):1357-69;PLoS One. 2011;6(4):e18597;J Virol. 2012 Feb;86(3):1844-52;J Virol. 2012 Mar;86(6):3400-1;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):799-808	MEDLINE	ppublish

The therapeutic effects of bacteriophage (phage) KPP12 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis were investigated in mice. Morphological analysis showed that phage KPP12 is a member of the family Myoviridae, morphotype A1, and DNA sequence analysis revealed that phage KPP12 is similar to PB1-like viruses. Analysis of the phage KPP12 genome did not identify any genes related to drug resistance, pathogenicity or lysogenicity, and so phage KPP12 may be a good candidate for therapeutic. KPP12 showed a broad host range for P. aeruginosa strains isolated from clinical ophthalmic infections. Inoculation of the scarified cornea with P. aeruginosa caused severe keratitis and eventual corneal perforation. Subsequent single-dose administration of KPP12 eye-drops significantly improved disease outcome, and preserved the structural integrity and transparency of the infected cornea. KPP12 treatment resulted in the suppression of neutrophil infiltration and greatly enhanced bacterial clearance in the infected cornea. These results indicate that bacteriophage eye-drops may be a novel adjunctive or alternative therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious keratitis secondary to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.	7	10	e47742	10.1371/journal.pone.0047742	Fukuda;Ishida;Uchiyama;Rashel;Kato;Morita;Muraoka;Sumi;Matsuzaki;Daibata;Fukushima	Ken;Waka;Jumpei;Mohammad;Shin-ichiro;Tamae;Asako;Tamaki;Shigenobu;Masanori;Atsuki	Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Kochi Medical School, Kochi, Japan. k.fukuda@kochi-u.ac.jp	eng	Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2000 Mar;41(3):805-10;Clin Exp Optom. 2011 Mar;94(2):161-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Mar 27;98(7):4107-12;Science. 2001 Dec 7;294(5549):2170-2;Infect Immun. 2002 Jan;70(1):204-10;Nature. 2002 Aug 22;418(6900):884-9;J Infect Dis. 2003 Feb 15;187(4):613-24;Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2003 Jun;2(6):489-97;Vestn Oftalmol. 1970 Nov-Dec;6:82-3;Bacteriol Rev. 1976 Dec;40(4):793-802;Curr Eye Res. 1982-1983;2(7):465-70;Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 1987;35(5):569-83;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Mol Microbiol. 1997 Aug;25(4):717-25;J Appl Microbiol. 2005;98(1):7-13;Int J Mol Med. 2006 Feb;17(2):309-17;Int J Mol Med. 2006 Feb;17(2):347-55;Optom Vis Sci. 2007 Apr;84(4):273-8;Singapore Med J. 2007 Aug;48(8):741-3;J Infect Dis. 2007 Oct 15;196(8):1237-47;Mol Biol Evol. 2008 Jul;25(7):1321-32;J Immunol. 2009 Feb 1;182(3):1609-16;PLoS One. 2009;4(3):e4944;Ophthalmologica. 2009;223(3):162-5;J Infect Dis. 2010 Jan 15;201(2):264-71;BMC Bioinformatics. 2010;11:119;Int J Med Microbiol. 2010 Aug;300(6):357-62;Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2000;48(6):547-51	MEDLINE	ppublish

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	1091-6490	Strain-dependent diversity in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing regulon.	Quorum sensing allows bacteria to sense and respond to changes in population density. Acyl-homoserine lactones serve as quorum-sensing signals for many Proteobacteria, and acyl-homoserine lactone signaling is known to control cooperative activities. Quorum-controlled activities vary from one species to another. Quorum-sensing controls a constellation of genes in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which thrives in a number of habitats ranging from soil and water to animal hosts. We hypothesized that there would be significant variation in quorum-sensing regulons among strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from different habitats and that differences in the quorum-sensing regulons might reveal insights about the ecology of P. aeruginosa. As a test of our hypothesis we used RNA-seq to identify quorum-controlled genes in seven P. aeruginosa isolates of diverse origins. Although our approach certainly overlooks some quorum-sensing-regulated genes we found a shared set of genes, i.e., a core quorum-controlled gene set, and we identified distinct, strain-variable sets of quorum-controlled genes, i.e., accessory genes. Some quorum-controlled genes in some strains were not present in the genomes of other strains. We detected a correlation between traits encoded by some genes in the strain-variable subsets of the quorum regulons and the ecology of the isolates. These findings indicate a role for quorum sensing in extension of the range of habitats in which a species can thrive. This study also provides a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which quorum-sensing systems operate, the evolutionary pressures by which they are maintained, and their importance in disparate ecological contexts.	109	41	E2823-31	10.1073/pnas.1214128109	Chugani;Kim;Phattarasukol;Brittnacher;Choi;Harwood;Greenberg	Sudha;Byoung Sik;Somsak;Mitchell J;Sang Ho;Caroline S;E Peter	Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.	eng	Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D596-600;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Oct;50(1):319-31;J Bacteriol. 2011 May;193(10):2598-607;Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2003;41:117-53;Environ Microbiol. 2003 Dec;5(12):1341-9;J Bacteriol. 2003 Dec;185(24):7222-30;Mol Biol Evol. 2004 May;21(5):903-13;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Jan 4;91(1):197-201;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1994 Jun;60(6):1734-8;J Bacteriol. 1994 Dec;176(24):7558-65;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Feb 28;92(5):1490-4;J Bacteriol. 1995 Dec;177(24):7155-63;Gene. 1998 May 28;212(1):77-86;J Gen Microbiol. 1955 Dec;13(3):572-81;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 May 31;102(22):8006-11;Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol. 2005;21:319-46;Int J Med Microbiol. 2006 Apr;296(2-3):73-81;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006 Nov;50(11):3674-9;Eur Respir J. 2011 Aug;38(2):409-14;Bioinformatics. 2011 Sep 1;27(17):2429-30;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2007 Mar;5(3):230-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 8;104(19):8101-6;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Apr;64(2):512-33;J Bacteriol. 2007 Nov;189(22):8387-91;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):821-9;Genomics. 2008 Jun;91(6):530-7;J Bacteriol. 2008 Sep;190(17):5915-23;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;Pediatr Pulmonol. 2009 Feb;44(2):142-7;Bioinformatics. 2009 Jul 15;25(14):1754-60;Nat Methods. 2009 Sep;6(9):647-9;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Sep;73(6):1072-85;J Cyst Fibros. 2010 May;9(3):158-64;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Nov 23;96(24):13904-9;Annu Rev Genet. 2001;35:439-68;J Bacteriol. 2002 Jun;184(11):3027-33;J Bacteriol. 2003 Apr;185(7):2066-79;J Bacteriol. 2003 Apr;185(7):2080-95;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 8;100(14):8484-9;EMBO J. 2003 Aug 1;22(15):3803-15;Eur Respir J. 2011 Mar;37(3):482-3	MEDLINE	ppublish

PloS one	PLoS ONE	1932-6203	Intestinal tissues induce an SNP mutation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that enhances its virulence: possible role in anastomotic leak.	The most feared complication following intestinal resection is anastomotic leakage. In high risk areas (esophagus/rectum) where neoadjuvant chemoradiation is used, the incidence of anastomotic leaks remains unacceptably high (≈ 10%) even when performed by specialist surgeons in high volume centers. The aims of this study were to test the hypothesis that anastomotic leakage develops when pathogens colonizing anastomotic sites become in vivo transformed to express a tissue destroying phenotype. We developed a novel model of anastomotic leak in which rats were exposed to pre-operative radiation as in cancer surgery, underwent distal colon resection and then were intestinally inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common colonizer of the radiated intestine. Results demonstrated that intestinal tissues exposed to preoperative radiation developed a significant incidence of anastomotic leak (>60%; p<0.01) when colonized by P. aeruginosa compared to radiated tissues alone (0%). Phenotype analysis comparing the original inoculating strain (MPAO1- termed P1) and the strain retrieved from leaking anastomotic tissues (termed P2) demonstrated that P2 was altered in pyocyanin production and displayed enhanced collagenase activity, high swarming motility, and a destructive phenotype against cultured intestinal epithelial cells (i.e. apoptosis, barrier function, cytolysis). Comparative genotype analysis between P1 and P2 revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation in the mexT gene that led to a stop codon resulting in a non-functional truncated protein. Replacement of the mutated mexT gene in P2 with mexT from the original parental strain P1 led to reversion of P2 to the P1 phenotype. No spontaneous transformation was detected during 20 passages in TSB media. Use of a novel virulence suppressing compound PEG/Pi prevented P. aeruginosa transformation to the tissue destructive phenotype and prevented anastomotic leak in rats. This work demonstrates that in vivo transformation of microbial pathogens to a tissue destroying phenotype may have important implications in the pathogenesis of anastomotic leak.	7	8	e44326	10.1371/journal.pone.0044326	Olivas;Shogan;Valuckaite;Zaborin;Belogortseva;Musch;Meyer;Trimble;An;Gilbert;Zaborina;Alverdy	Andrea D;Benjamin D;Vesta;Alexander;Natalya;Mark;Folker;William L;Gary;Jack;Olga;John C	Department of Surgery, University of Chicago, Illinois, USA.	eng	J Bacteriol. 2011 Jan;193(2):399-410;J Basic Microbiol. 2008 Dec;48(6):509-15;Am J Surg. 2011 Sep;202(3):259-64;Ann Surg. 1997 Feb;225(2):172-80;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:75;J Bacteriol. 2001 Sep;183(18):5213-22;J Bacteriol. 1999 Oct;181(20):6300-5;Science. 2005 Jul 29;309(5735):774-7;PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e34883;Ann Surg. 1955 May;141(5):707-17;J Bacteriol. 2010 Feb;192(4):1113-21;J Gastrointest Surg. 2011 Dec;15(12):2251-61;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;J Korean Soc Coloproctol. 2010 Aug;26(4):265-73;Microb Pathog. 2009 Oct;47(4):237-41;PLoS Pathog. 2007 Mar;3(3):e35;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2010 Oct;311(1):36-43;Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob. 2006;5:14;Surgery. 1985 Apr;97(4):443-6;Colorectal Dis. 2001 May;3(3):154-60;Ann Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2001 Apr;7(2):75-8;Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2009 Dec;297(6):G1041-52;Br J Surg. 2011 Oct;98(10):1365-72;Ann Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2004 Apr;10(2):71-5;Surgery. 2010 Jun;147(6):757-65;Mol Microbiol. 2012 Feb;83(3):536-47;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1994 Nov;38(11):2564-7;BMC Mol Biol. 2008;9:20;Arch Surg. 2009 May;144(5):407-11; discussion 411-2;Genome Res. 2004 Jun;14(6):1147-59;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Apr 14;106(15):6327-32;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Dec;37(22):7546-59;BMC Microbiol. 2011;11:212;Ann Surg. 2007 Feb;245(2):254-8;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2000 Nov 1;192(1):107-12	MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriol.	1098-5530	The CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa mediates resistance to naturally occurring and engineered phages.	Here we report the isolation of 6 temperate bacteriophages (phages) that are prevented from replicating within the laboratory strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 by the endogenous CRISPR/Cas system of this microbe. These phages are only the second identified group of naturally occurring phages demonstrated to be blocked for replication by a nonengineered CRISPR/Cas system, and our results provide the first evidence that the P. aeruginosa type I-F CRISPR/Cas system can function in phage resistance. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and a proximal 8-nucleotide seed sequence in mediating CRISPR/Cas-based immunity. Through engineering of a protospacer region of phage DMS3 to make it a target of resistance by the CRISPR/Cas system and screening for mutants that escape CRISPR/Cas-mediated resistance, we show that nucleotides within the PAM and seed sequence and across the non-seed-sequence regions are critical for the functioning of this CRISPR/Cas system. We also demonstrate that P. aeruginosa can acquire spacer content in response to lytic phage challenge, illustrating the adaptive nature of this CRISPR/Cas system. Finally, we demonstrate that the P. aeruginosa CRISPR/Cas system mediates a gradient of resistance to a phage based on the level of complementarity between CRISPR spacer RNA and phage protospacer target. This work introduces a new in vivo system to study CRISPR/Cas-mediated resistance and an additional set of tools for the elucidation of CRISPR/Cas function.	194	21	5728-38	10.1128/JB.01184-12	Cady;Bondy-Denomy;Heussler;Davidson;O'Toole	Kyle C;Joe;Gary E;Alan R;George A	Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.	eng	Science. 2008 Aug 15;321(5891):960-4;Science. 2012 Aug 17;337(6096):816-21;Microbiology. 2009 Mar;155(Pt 3):733-40;Structure. 2009 Jun 10;17(6):904-12;Trends Biochem Sci. 2009 Aug;34(8):401-7;Cell. 2009 Nov 25;139(5):945-56;Future Microbiol. 2010 Jul;5(7):1041-55;Science. 2010 Sep 10;329(5997):1355-8;Nature. 2010 Nov 4;468(7320):67-71;Microbiology. 2011 Feb;157(Pt 2):430-7;Nature. 2011 Mar 31;471(7340):602-7;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jun 21;108(25):10092-7;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jun 21;108(25):10098-103;J Bacteriol. 2011 Jul;193(14):3433-45;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Mar;45(3):649-59;Nature. 2003 Nov 20;426(6964):306-10;J Bacteriol. 2004 May;186(10):3270-3;Can J Microbiol. 1980 Feb;26(2):146-54;J Bacteriol. 1991 Oct;173(20):6578-85;J Biol Chem. 1992 Feb 15;267(5):3168-72;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2006 Jul;72(7):5027-36;Science. 2007 Mar 23;315(5819):1709-12;Annu Rev Genet. 2011;45:273-97;J Virol. 2012 Mar;86(6):3400-1;PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e35888;Mol Cell. 2012 Jun 8;46(5):595-605;Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Jul;40(12):5569-76;Nat Commun. 2012;3:945;J Bacteriol. 2009 Jan;191(1):210-9	MEDLINE	ppublish

U.S.A.	1091-6490	General and inducible hypermutation facilitate parallel adaptation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa despite divergent mutation spectra.	The successful growth of hypermutator strains of bacteria contradicts a clear preference for lower mutation rates observed in the microbial world. Whether by general DNA repair deficiency or the inducible action of low-fidelity DNA polymerases, the evolutionary strategies of bacteria include methods of hypermutation. Although both raise mutation rate, general and inducible hypermutation operate through distinct molecular mechanisms and therefore likely impart unique adaptive consequences. Here we compare the influence of general and inducible hypermutation on adaptation in the model organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 through experimental evolution. We observed divergent spectra of single base substitutions derived from general and inducible hypermutation by sequencing rpoB in spontaneous rifampicin-resistant (Rif(R)) mutants. Likewise, the pattern of mutation in a draft genome sequence of a derived inducible hypermutator isolate differed from those of general hypermutators reported in the literature. However, following experimental evolution, populations of both mutator types exhibited comparable improvements in fitness across varied conditions that differed from the highly specific adaptation of nonmutators. Our results suggest that despite their unique mutation spectra, general and inducible hypermutation can analogously influence the ecology and adaptation of bacteria, significantly shaping pathogenic populations where hypermutation has been most widely observed.	109	34	13680-5	10.1073/pnas.1205357109	Weigand;Sundin	Michael R;George W	Program in Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.	eng	Science. 2000 May 19;288(5469):1251-4;Environ Microbiol. 2011 Jul;13(7):1690-704;J Bacteriol. 2000 Nov;182(21):6137-44;Bioessays. 2000 Dec;22(12):1057-66;Cell. 2001 Mar 23;104(6):901-12;Mol Cell. 2001 Jul;8(1):7-8;Microbiology. 2002 May;148(Pt 5):1247-52;DNA Repair (Amst). 2003 May 13;2(5):593-608;Nat Rev Genet. 2003 Jun;4(6):457-69;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2003 Oct 15;168(8):918-51;Microbiology. 2004 May;150(Pt 5):1327-38;Mol Gen Genet. 1975;138(2):127-41;Mutat Res. 1978 Apr;50(1):19-28;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Sep;84(17):6220-4;J Gen Microbiol. 1990 Jul;136(7):1241-9;J Bacteriol. 1997 Dec;179(23):7435-45;Microb Ecol. 2005 Jan;49(1):104-13;Microbiology. 2006 Sep;152(Pt 9):2505-14;Nat Genet. 2006 Dec;38(12):1406-12;J Infect Dis. 2007 Jan 1;195(1):70-80;Genome Biol. 2007;8(1):201;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Apr;64(2):547-59;Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Jul;8(7):587-94;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2007 Nov;31(6):637-56;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2007 Dec;277(1):11-20;Eur Respir J. 2008 Apr;31(4):822-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jul 1;36(Web Server issue):W181-4;J Bacteriol. 2008 Dec;190(24):7910-7;Genetics. 2009 Jan;181(1):199-208;Nature. 2009 Oct 29;461(7268):1243-7;Mutat Res. 2010 Jan 5;683(1-2):106-14;J Bacteriol. 2010 Feb;192(4):1113-21;Mol Biol Evol. 2010 Jun;27(6):1338-47;Mol Microbiol. 2010 Aug;77(3):540-8;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2010 Jul;16(7):798-808;Genetics. 2011 Mar;187(3):817-22;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64	MEDLINE	ppublish

Microbiol.	1462-2920	Deletion and acquisition of genomic content during early stage adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to a human host environment.	Adaptation of bacterial pathogens to a permanently host-associated lifestyle by means of deletion or acquisition of genetic material is usually examined through comparison of present-day isolates to a distant theoretical ancestor. This limits the resolution of the adaptation process. We conducted a retrospective study of the dissemination of the P.aeruginosa DK2 clone type among patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, sequencing the genomes of 45 isolates collected from 16 individuals over 35 years. Analysis of the genomes provides a high-resolution examination of the dynamics and mechanisms of the change in genetic content during the early stage of host adaptation by this P.aeruginosa strain as it adapts to the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung of several patients. Considerable genome reduction is detected predominantly through the deletion of large genomic regions, and up to 8% of the genome is deleted in one isolate. Compared with in vitro estimates the resulting average deletion rates are 12- to 36-fold higher. Deletions occur through both illegitimate and homologous recombination, but they are not IS element mediated as previously reported for early stage host adaptation. Uptake of novel DNA sequences during infection is limited as only one prophage region was putatively inserted in one isolate, demonstrating that early host adaptation is characterized by the reduction of genomic repertoire rather than acquisition of novel functions. Finally, we also describe the complete genome of this highly adapted pathogenic strain of P.aeruginosa to strengthen the genetic basis, which serves to help our understanding of microbial evolution in a natural environment.	14	8	2200-11	10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02795.x	Rau;Marvig;Ehrlich;Molin;Jelsbak	Martin H;Rasmus Lykke;Garth D;Søren;Lars	Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark, 2800 Lyngby, Denmark.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a highly adaptable bacterium that thrives in a broad range of ecological niches and can infect multiple hosts as diverse as plants, nematodes and mammals. In humans, it is an important opportunistic pathogen. This wide adaptability correlates with its broad genetic diversity. In this study, we used a deep-sequencing approach to explore the complement of small RNAs (sRNAs) in P. aeruginosa as the number of such regulatory molecules previously identified in this organism is relatively low, considering its genome size, phenotypic diversity and adaptability. We have performed a comparative analysis of PAO1 and PA14 strains which share the same host range but differ in virulence, PA14 being considerably more virulent in several model organisms. Altogether, we have identified more than 150 novel candidate sRNAs and validated a third of them by Northern blotting. Interestingly, a number of these novel sRNAs are strain-specific or showed strain-specific expression, strongly suggesting that they could be involved in determining specific phenotypic traits.	7	5	e36553	10.1371/journal.pone.0036553	Ferrara;Brugnoli;De Bonis;Righetti;Delvillani;Dehò;Horner;Briani;Bertoni	Silvia;Margherita;Angela;Francesco;Francesco;Gianni;David;Federica;Giovanni	Dipartimento di Scienze Biomolecolari e Biotecnologie, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.	eng	PLoS Pathog. 2010 Mar;6(3):e1000809;EMBO J. 1993 Oct;12(10):3967-75;Cell. 1983 Sep;34(2):683-91;Virology. 1996 Sep 1;223(1):57-67;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Jun 29;101(26):9792-7;Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol. 2006;71:1-11;Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2011 Dec;3(12). pii: a003798. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a003798;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2008 Mar;6(3):181-6;Biochimie. 2011 Nov;93(11):1943-9;Mol Cell. 2011 Sep 16;43(6):880-91;PLoS Biol. 2007 Sep;5(9):e229;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Apr;37(6):e46;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2010 Dec;74(4):621-41;J Bacteriol. 2006 Aug;188(16):6026-33;Cell. 2009 Nov 13;139(4):770-9;Res Microbiol. 2010 Mar;161(2):136-43;J Bacteriol. 2009 Jan;191(1):210-9;Science. 1995 Jun 30;268(5219):1899-902;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005;33(3):1040-50;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Aug;73(3):434-45;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Dec 18;104(51):20454-9;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2011 Jul;91(1):63-79;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Aug 1;97(16):8815-21;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Jan;71(1):1-11;Cell Host Microbe. 2010 Jul 22;8(1):116-27;EMBO J. 1990 Apr;9(4):1267-74;PLoS Comput Biol. 2009 Sep;5(9):e1000502;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Nov 15;31(22):6435-43;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2011 Aug;9(8):578-89;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2010 Feb;13(1):18-23;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 24;101(8):2530-5;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2011 Jul;35(4):652-80;PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31092;Mol Microbiol. 2011 May;80(4):868-85;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:167;Cell. 2009 Feb 20;136(4):615-28;Front Microbiol. 2011 Jul 13;2:150;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Dec 22;106(51):21866-71;J Bacteriol. 2004 May;186(10):2936-45;J Bacteriol. 2011 Jul;193(14):3433-45;Microbiology. 2008 Oct;154(Pt 10):3175-87;J Bacteriol. 2010 Jul;192(13):3249-58;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2011 Jun;75(2):286-300;Nucleic Acids Res. 2006;34(12):3484-93	MEDLINE	ppublish

Biotechnol.	1432-0614	Characterization of lytic Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophages via biological properties and genomic sequences.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important cause of infections, especially in patients with immunodeficiency or diabetes. Antibiotics are effective in preventing morbidity and mortality from Pseudomonas infection, but because of spreading multidrug-resistant bacterial strains, bacteriophages are being explored as an alternative therapy. Two newly purified broad host range Pseudomonas phages, named vB_Pae-Kakheti25 and vB_Pae-TbilisiM32, were characterized as candidates for use in phage therapy. Morphology, host range, growth properties, thermal stability, serology, genomic sequence, and virion composition are reported. When phages are used as bactericides, they are used in mixtures to overcome the development of resistance in the targeted bacterial population. These two phages are representative of diverse siphoviral and podoviral phage families, respectively, and hence have unrelated mechanisms of infection and no cross-antigenicity. Composing bactericidal phage mixtures with members of different phage families may decrease the incidence of developing resistance through a common mechanism.	94	6	1609-17	10.1007/s00253-012-4119-8	Karumidze;Thomas;Kvatadze;Goderdzishvili;Hakala;Weintraub;Alavidze;Hardies	Natia;Julie A;Nino;Marina;Kevin W;Susan T;Zemphira;Stephen C	Eliava Institute of Bacteriophages, Microbiology and Virology, Tbilisi, Georgia.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

The diversity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophages was investigated using a collection of 68 phages isolated from Central Mexico.

Comparison of the genomes of selected archetypal phages with extant sequences in GenBank resulted in the identification of six novel species. This finding increased the group diversity by ~30%. The great diversity of phage species could be related to the ubiquitous nature of P. aeruginosa.	78	12	4510-5	10.1128/AEM.00065-12	Sepúlveda-Robles;Kameyama;Guarneros	Omar;Luis;Gabriel	Departamento de Genética y Biología Molecular, Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CINVESTAV-IPN), Mexico City, Mexico.	eng	J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):400-10;J Clin Microbiol. 2003 Mar;41(3):1192-202;J Bacteriol. 2004 May;186(10):3270-3;Intervirology. 1974;3(4):201-19;J Virol. 1977 Sep;23(3):461-6;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1984 Feb;47(2):343-9;BMC Microbiol. 2011;11:102;Mol Gen Genet. 1986 Mar;202(3):467-70;Ann Inst Pasteur Virol. 1988 Oct-Dec;139(4):389-404;Mol Microbiol. 1990 Oct;4(10):1703-9;Arch Virol. 1992;124(1-2):69-82;Arch Virol. 1993;131(1-2):141-51;Protein Expr Purif. 1995 Aug;6(4):423-30;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1998 Nov;64(11):4128-33;Environ Microbiol. 2005 Jul;7(7):969-80;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(3):1184-7;Genetika. 2006 Jan;42(1):33-8;J Bacteriol. 2006 Oct;188(19):6924-31;Commun Agric Appl Biol Sci. 2006;71(1):95-8;Arch Virol. 2007 Feb;152(2):227-43;Cell Microbiol. 2007 Feb;9(2):479-91;Microbiology. 2007 Sep;153(Pt 9):2885-95;Res Microbiol. 2007 Sep;158(7):572-81;J Bacteriol. 2008 Feb;190(4):1429-35;Genetika. 2008 Feb;44(2):185-94;Res Microbiol. 2008 Jun;159(5):406-14;PLoS One. 2008;3(9):e3263;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;Environ Microbiol. 2009 May;11(5):1303-13;BMC Microbiol. 2009;9:224;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2874-83;PLoS One. 2010;5(1):e8842;Int J Food Microbiol. 2010 Mar 31;138(1-2):137-44;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104;Future Microbiol. 2010 Jul;5(7):1041-55;Virol J. 2010;7:163;Genetika. 1984 Oct;20(10):1612-9;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Genome Biol. 2004;5(2):R12	MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of infection in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). In addition, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance of Pseudomonas are major problems that can complicate antibiotic therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of using bacteriophages to kill the pathogen in both biofilms and in the murine lung. We isolated and characterized two phages from a local wastewater treatment plant, a myovirus (φNH-4) and a podovirus (φMR299-2). Both phages were active against clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. Together, the two phages killed all 9 clinical isolate strains tested, including both mucoid and nonmucoid strains. An equal mixture of the two phages was effective in killing P. aeruginosa NH57388A (mucoid) and P. aeruginosa MR299 (nonmucoid) strains when growing as a biofilm on a cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial CFBE41o- cell line. Phage titers increased almost 100-fold over a 24-h period, confirming replication of the phage. Furthermore, the phage mix was also effective in killing the pathogen in murine lungs containing 1 × 10(7) to 2 × 10(7) P. aeruginosa. Pseudomonas was effectively cleared (reduced by a magnitude of at least 3 to 4 log units) from murine lungs in 6 h. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of these two phages in killing clinical Pseudomonas isolates in the murine lung or as a biofilm on a pulmonary cell line and supports the growing interest in using phage therapy for the control and treatment of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas lung infections in CF patients.;Given the rise in antibiotic resistance, nonantibiotic therapies are required for the treatment of infection. This is particularly true for the treatment of Pseudomonas infection in patients with cystic fibrosis. We have identified two bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) that can kill Pseudomonas growing on human lung cells and in an animal model of lung infection. The use of bacteriophages is particularly appropriate because the killing agent can replicate on the target cell, generating fresh copies of the bacteriophage. Thus, in the presence of a target, the killing agent multiplies. By using two bacteriophages we can reduce the risk of resistant colonies developing at the site of infection. Bacteriophage therapy is an exciting field, and this study represents an important demonstration of efficacy in validated infection models.	3	2	e00029-12	10.1128/mBio.00029-12	Alemayehu;Casey;McAuliffe;Guinane;Martin;Shanahan;Coffey;Ross;Hill	Debebe;Pat G;Olivia;Caitriona M;James G;Fergus;Aidan;R Paul;Colin	TEAGASC Food Research Centre, Moorepark, Fermoy, Co.

A novel Pseudomonas aeruginosa lytic bacteriophage (phage), PA1Ø, was isolated, and its genome was sequenced completely. This phage is able to lyse not only P. aeruginosa but also Staphylococcus aureus. Genome analysis of PA1Ø showed that it is similar to a P. aeruginosa temperate phage, D3112, with the exception of the absence of a c repressor-encoding gene, which is known to play a critical role in the maintenance of the lysogenic state of D3112 in P. aeruginosa.	86	6	3400-1	10.1128/JVI.07191-11	Kim;Rahman;Kim	Shukho;Marzia;Jungmin	Department of Microbiology, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.	eng	Bioinformatics. 2000 Mar;16(3):290-1;J Appl Microbiol. 2011 Jul;111(1):1-7;Curr Issues Mol Biol. 2001 Jul;3(3):47-55;Dev Cell. 2002 Oct;3(4):593-603;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):400-10;J Bacteriol. 1989 Jul;171(7):3909-16;J Bacteriol. 1990 Apr;172(4):1899-904;Science. 1997 Oct 24;278(5338):631-7;Drugs. 2007;67(3):351-68;Bioinformatics. 2007 Mar 15;23(6):673-9;Future Microbiol. 2007 Apr;2(2):153-64;J Wound Care. 2009 Jun;18(6):237-8, 240-3;Vet Microbiol. 2010 Dec 15;146(3-4):309-13;Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jan;39(Database issue):D32-7;Virology. 2000 Jun 20;272(1):85-97	MEDLINE	ppublish

Metagenomic analysis of milk samples collected from Kankrej, Gir (Bos indicus) and crossbred (Bos taurus × B. indicus) cattle harbouring subclinical mastitis was carried out by next-generation sequencing 454 GS-FLX technology to elucidate the microbial community structure of cattle milk.;Milk samples from Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle were subjected to metagenomic profiling by pyrosequencing. The Metagenomic analysis produced 63·07, 11·09 and 7·87 million base pairs (Mb) of sequence data, assembled in 264 798, 56 114 and 36 762 sequences with an average read length of 238, 197 and 214 nucleotides in Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle, respectively. Phylogenetic and metabolic profiles by the web-based tool MG-RAST revealed that the members of Enterobacteriales were predominant in mastitic milk followed by Pseudomonadales, Bacillales and Lactobacillales. Around 56 different species with varying abundance were detected in the subclinically infected milk. Escherichia coli was found to be the most predominant species in Kankrej and Gir cattle followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mendocina, Shigella flexneri and Bacillus cereus. In crossbred cattle, Staphylococcus aureus followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and E. coli were detected in descending order. Metabolic profiling indicated fluoroquinolones, methicillin, copper, cobalt-zinc-cadmium as the groups of antibiotics and toxic compounds to which the organisms showed resistance. Sequences indicating potential of organisms exhibiting multidrug resistance against antibiotics and resistance to toxic compounds were also present. Interestingly, presence of bacteriophages against Staph. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacter and Yersinia species was also observed.;The analysis identified potential infectious organisms in mastitis, resistance of organisms to antibiotics and chemical compounds and the natural resistance potential of dairy cows.;The findings of this study may help in formulating strategies for the prevention and treatment of mastitis in dairy animals and consequently in reducing economic losses incurred because of it.	112	4	639-50	10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05244.x	Bhatt;Ahir;Koringa;Jakhesara;Rank;Nauriyal;Kunjadia;Joshi	V D;V B;P G;S J;D N;D S;A P;C G	Ashok and Rita Patel Institute of Integrated Study and Research in Biotechnology and Allied Sciences, Anand, Gujarat, India. bhatt_vbhv@yahoo.co.in	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriophage (phage) KPP10 has been used in experimental phage therapies directed against P. aeruginosa infections. To examine the eligibility of phage KPP10 as a therapeutic phage, its genome was analyzed. The genomic DNA was shown to be 88,322 bp long, with 158 open reading frames (ORFs), and three tRNA genes were predicted. No ORF-encoded pathogenicity or lysogenization factor was predicted. A comparative genomic analysis revealed that phage KPP10, together with phage PAK_P3, can be grouped as a new type of lytic phage infecting P. aeruginosa. Phage KPP10 is considered to be suitable for therapeutic purposes because it is a lytic phage without ORF-encoded pathogenicity or a lysogenization factors.	157	4	733-8	10.1007/s00705-011-1210-x	Uchiyama;Rashel;Takemura;Kato;Ujihara;Muraoka;Matsuzaki;Daibata	Jumpei;Mohammad;Iyo;Shin-Ichiro;Takako;Asako;Shigenobu;Masanori	Department of Microbiology and Infection, Faculty of Medicine, Kochi University, Kohasu, Oko-cho, Nankoku, Kochi, 783-8505, Japan.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Virol.	1098-5514	Complete genome sequence of the giant virus OBP and comparative genome analysis of the diverse ΦKZ-related phages.	The 283,757-bp double-stranded DNA genome of Pseudomonas fluorescens phage OBP shares a general genomic organization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage EL. Comparison of this genomic organization, assembled in syntenic genomic blocks interspersed with hyperplastic regions of the ΦKZ-related phages, supports the proposed division in the EL-like viruses, and the phiKZ-like viruses within a larger subfamily. Identification of putative early transcription promoters scattered throughout the hyperplastic regions explains several features of the ΦKZ-related genome organization (existence of genomic islands) and evolution (multi-inversion in hyperplastic regions). When hidden Markov modeling was used, typical conserved core genes could be identified, including the portal protein, the injection needle, and two polypeptides with respective similarity to the 3'-5' exonuclease domain and the polymerase domain of the T4 DNA polymerase. While the N-terminal domains of the tail fiber module and peptidoglycan-degrading proteins are conserved, the observation of C-terminal catalytic domains typical for the different genera supports the further subdivision of the ΦKZ-related phages.	86	3	1844-52	10.1128/JVI.06330-11	Cornelissen;Hardies;Shaburova;Krylov;Mattheus;Kropinski;Lavigne	Anneleen;Stephen C;Olga V;Victor N;Wesley;Andrew M;Rob	Laboratory of Gene Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.	eng	Structure. 2004 Nov;12(11):2001-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Oct 1;27(19):3911-20;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W244-8;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2005 Aug;8(4):480-7;J Mol Biol. 2005 Dec 2;354(3):536-45;Mol Biol Evol. 2006 Sep;23(9):1688-96;Genetika. 2006 Aug;42(8):1065-74;J Mol Biol. 2006 Dec 8;364(4):667-77;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Sep;65(5):1334-44;Structure. 2007 Sep;15(9):1099-104;Arch Virol. 2007;152(10):1955-9;Genome Res. 2007 Oct;17(10):1486-95;Virology. 2007 Nov 25;368(2):405-21;Virol J. 2007;4:97;J Biol Chem. 2008 Mar 14;283(11):7242-50;Virology. 2008 Jul 5;376(2):330-8;Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 Oct 3;374(4):747-51;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jan;37(Database issue):D136-40;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jan;37(Database issue):D72-6;BMC Microbiol. 2009;9:224;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2775-7;Microbiology. 2011 Mar;157(Pt 3):859-67;Virology. 2007 Jun 5;362(2):384-96;Proteomics. 2009 Jun;9(11):3215-9;Bioinformatics. 1999 Nov;15(11):874-86;J Mol Biol. 2000 Nov 17;304(1):35-42;J Mol Biol. 2001 Jan 19;305(3):567-80;Cell. 2001 Jun 1;105(5):657-67;J Mol Biol. 2002 Mar 15;317(1):1-19;Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2003 Jan;35(1):16-21;Protein Sci. 2003 Aug;12(8):1652-62;Bioinformatics. 2004 Mar 22;20(5):629-35;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Apr 27;101(17):6415-20;Genome Res. 2004 Jun;14(6):1188-90;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jul 1;32(Web Server issue):W20-5;J Mol Biol. 2004 Jul 16;340(4):783-95;Vopr Virusol. 1978 Sep-Oct;(5):568-71;Can J Microbiol. 1984 Jun;30(6):758-62;Genetics. 1987 Mar;115(3):393-403;New Biol. 1989 Nov;1(2):171-9;Science. 1991 May 24;252(5009):1162-4;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Mar 15;89(6):2002-6;Comput Appl Biosci. 1996 Apr;12(2):95-107;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Cell. 1997 Jun 27;89(7):1087-99;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Feb 15;26(4):1107-15;Bioinformatics. 1998;14(1):48-54;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Jan 1;27(1):293-4;Bioinformatics. 1998;14(9):755-63;Bioinformatics. 1998;14(10):846-56;Bioinformatics. 2005 Apr 1;21(7):951-60	MEDLINE	ppublish

The zebrafish embryo is an important in vivo model to study the host innate immune response towards microbial infection. In most zebrafish infectious disease models, infection is achieved by micro-injection of bacteria into the embryo. Alternatively, Edwardsiella tarda, a natural fish pathogen, has been used to treat embryos by static immersion. In this study we used transcriptome profiling and quantitative RT-PCR to analyze the immune response induced by E. tarda immersion and injection.;Mortality rates after static immersion of embryos in E. tarda suspension varied between 25-75%, while intravenous injection of bacteria resulted in 100% mortality. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis on the level of single embryos showed that expression of the proinflammatory marker genes il1b and mmp9 was induced only in some embryos that were exposed to E. tarda in the immersion system, whereas intravenous injection of E. tarda led to il1b and mmp9 induction in all embryos. In addition, microarray expression profiles of embryos subjected to immersion or injection showed little overlap. E. tarda-injected embryos displayed strong induction of inflammatory and defense genes and of regulatory genes of the immune response. E. tarda-immersed embryos showed transient induction of the cytochrome P450 gene cyp1a. This gene was also induced after immersion in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa suspensions, but, in contrast, was not induced upon intravenous E. tarda injection. One of the rare common responses in the immersion and injection systems was induction of irg1l, a homolog of a murine immunoresponsive gene of unknown function.;Based on the differences in mortality rates between experiments and gene expression profiles of individual embryos we conclude that zebrafish embryos cannot be reproducibly infected by exposure to E. tarda in the immersion system. Induction of il1b and mmp9 was consistently observed in embryos that had been systemically infected by intravenous injection, while the early transcriptional induction of cyp1a and irg1l in the immersion system may reflect an epithelial or other tissue response towards cell membrane or other molecules that are shed or released by bacteria. Our microarray expression data provide a useful reference for future analysis of signal transduction pathways underlying the systemic innate immune response versus those underlying responses to external bacteria and secreted virulence factors and toxins.	12		58	10.1186/1471-2172-12-58	van Soest;Stockhammer;Ordas;Bloemberg;Spaink;Meijer	Joost J;Oliver W;Anita;Guido V;Herman P;Annemarie H	Institute of Biology, Leiden University, PO Box 9502, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands.	eng	J Bacteriol. 1990 May;172(5):2236-40;Dev Comp Immunol. 2008;32(1):36-49;Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2008 Sep;25(3):264-70;Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol. 2009 Mar;296(3):R549-57;Cell Microbiol. 2008 Nov;10(11):2312-25;Genome Biol. 2007;8(11):R251;Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2008 Oct;25(4):341-50;Aquat Toxicol. 2009 Jan 18;91(1):62-70;Infect Immun. 2009 Nov;77(11):5190-201;Dev Comp Immunol. 2005;29(6):501-13;Am J Physiol Renal Physiol. 2004 Feb;286(2):F356-62;Development. 1999 Sep;126(17):3735-45;Immunogenetics. 1995;41(5):263-70;Mol Cell Endocrinol. 1992 Dec;90(1):7-15;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1990;44:335-63;Dev Dyn. 1999 Apr;214(4):323-36;Infect Immun. 2002 Jul;70(7):3904-14;Blood. 2006 Dec 15;108(13):3976-8;Science. 2010 Jan 22;327(5964):466-9;Zebrafish. 2005;2(2):87-103;Methods Mol Biol. 2009;546:255-71;J Exp Med. 2003 Oct 6;198(7):987-97;BMC Res Notes. 2010 Mar 16;3:73;Curr Drug Targets. 2011 Jun;12(7):1000-17;Mol Immunol. 2004 Jan;40(11):773-83;Mol Microbiol. 1991 Oct;5(10):2315-21;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 1;104(18):7622-7;Am J Physiol Renal Physiol. 2007 Feb;292(2):F895-904;Genome Biol. 2003;4(5):P3;Cell Microbiol. 2009 May;11(5):755-68;Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2008 Aug 15;124(3-4):295-301;J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2009 Jan;29(1):55-67;J Leukoc Biol. 2006 Mar;79(3):628-38;Dev Comp Immunol. 2004 Jan;28(1):9-28;Mol Immunol. 2007 Jan;44(4):295-301;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009 Apr;22(2):240-73, Table of Contents;Blood. 2008 Jan 1;111(1):132-41;Dev Comp Immunol. 2008;32(7):745-57;Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1997 Apr;143(2):256-73;Dev Biol. 2001 Oct 15;238(2):274-88;Blood. 2011 Jan 27;117(4):e49-56;Oncogene. 2004 Sep 20;23(43):7233-46;BMC Bioinformatics. 2006;7:470;J Immunol. 2009 May 1;182(9):5641-53;Curr Opin Immunol. 2010 Feb;22(1):10-9;Infect Immun. 2010 Apr;78(4):1495-508;Immunity. 2002 Dec;17(6):693-702;Infect Immun. 2009 Apr;77(4):1293-303;Methods Cell Biol. 2011;105:273-308;PLoS One. 2011;6(2):e16779;J Leukoc Biol. 2009 Oct;86(4):981-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Dec 21;96(26):15202-7;Cell Microbiol. 2003 Sep;5(9):601-11;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2010 Apr;305(1):81-90	MEDLINE	epublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), adapts for survival in the CF lung through both mutation and gene expression changes. Frequent clonal strains such as the Australian Epidemic Strain-1 (AES-1), have increased ability to establish infection in the CF lung and to superimpose and replace infrequent clonal strains. Little is known about the factors underpinning these properties. Analysis has been hampered by lack of expression array templates containing CF-strain specific genes. We sequenced the genome of an acute infection AES-1 isolate from a CF infant (AES-1R) and constructed a non-redundant micro-array (PANarray) comprising AES-1R and seven other sequenced P. aeruginosa genomes. The unclosed AES-1R genome comprised 6.254Mbp and contained 6957 putative genes, including 338 not found in the other seven genomes. The PANarray contained 12,543 gene probe spots; comprising 12,147 P. aeruginosa gene probes, 326 quality-control probes and 70 probes for non-P. aeruginosa genes, including phage and plant genes. We grew AES-1R and its isogenic pair AES-1M, taken from the same patient 10.5 years later and not eradicated in the intervening period, in our validated artificial sputum medium (ASMDM) and used the PANarray to compare gene expression of both in duplicate. 675 genes were differentially expressed between the isogenic pairs, including upregulation of alginate, biofilm, persistence genes and virulence-related genes such as dihydroorotase, uridylate kinase and cardiolipin synthase, in AES-1M. Non-PAO1 genes upregulated in AES-1M included pathogenesis-related (PAGI-5) genes present in strains PACS2 and PA7, and numerous phage genes. Elucidation of these genes' roles could lead to targeted treatment strategies for chronically infected CF patients.	6	9	e24526	10.1371/journal.pone.0024526	Naughton;Parker;Seemann;Thomas;Turnbull;Rose;Bye;Cordwell;Whitchurch;Manos	Sharna;Dane;Torsten;Torsten;Lynne;Barbara;Peter;Stuart;Cynthia;Jim	Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.	eng	Microbiology. 2008 Jan;154(Pt 1):103-13;Cell. 1984 May;37(1):67-75;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2005 Jun 1;171(11):1209-23;J Med Microbiol. 2008 Dec;57(Pt 12):1454-65;Int J Med Microbiol. 2010 Dec;300(8):557-62;Curr Genomics. 2007 May;8(3):191-202;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;J Bacteriol. 2009 Jun;191(11):3492-503;J Clin Microbiol. 1995 Sep;33(9):2233-9;Microbiology. 2004 May;150(Pt 5):1315-26;J Bacteriol. 2003 May;185(9):2700-10;J Bacteriol. 2008 Nov;190(21):7130-40;Dev Cell. 2002 Oct;3(4):593-603;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Lancet. 1993 Apr 24;341(8852):1065-9;Genome Res. 2003 Sep;13(9):2178-89;J Bacteriol. 1994 Jun;176(12):3500-7;Infect Immun. 2010 Apr;78(4):1437-46;Microbiology. 2007 Oct;153(Pt 10):3264-74;Microbiology. 2009 Apr;155(Pt 4):1050-7;Microbiology. 2008 Jun;154(Pt 6):1616-27;J Bacteriol. 1995 Dec;177(24):7019-25;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;J Bacteriol. 2004 Dec;186(24):8478-89;Microbiology. 2005 Mar;151(Pt 3):985-97;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2003 Oct 15;168(8):918-51;J Bacteriol. 2008 Oct;190(20):6927-30;Infect Immun. 2001 Jan;69(1):538-42;J Med Microbiol. 2010 Sep;59(Pt 9):1089-100;Microbiology. 2009 Jul;155(Pt 7):2148-56;Microbiol Rev. 1996 Sep;60(3):539-74;J Immunol. 2005 Dec 1;175(11):7512-8;J Bacteriol. 2004 Oct;186(19):6560-74;Mol Gen Genet. 1994 Jan;242(2):177-84;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Jan;39(2):291-303;Infect Immun. 1989 May;57(5):1369-73;Infect Immun. 1996 Feb;64(2):518-23;J Lipid Res. 2003 Mar;44(3):621-9;J Bacteriol. 2008 Dec;190(24):7910-7;Infect Immun. 2005 Jul;73(7):3999-4006;J Clin Microbiol. 2002 Aug;40(8):2772-8;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2009 Mar;292(1):107-14;Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Jun 15;29(12):2607-18;Pediatr Pulmonol. 2001 Oct;32(4):277-87;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2005 May 1;171(9):1020-5;Transl Res. 2008 Dec;152(6):257-64;Environ Microbiol. 2007 May;9(5):1135-45;J Clin Microbiol. 2003 May;41(5):2266-7;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2011 Sep;17(9):1415-20;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Apr 27;101(17):6664-8;Infect Immun. 2009 Apr;77(4):1293-303;J Infect Dis. 2009 Jul 1;200(1):118-30;Microb Biotechnol. 2009 Jan;2(1):62-74;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Jan;47(1):145-58;Science. 2000 May 19;288(5469):1251-4;Thorax. 2004 Apr;59(4):334-6;J Bacteriol. 2010 Jul;192(13):3249-58	MEDLINE	ppublish

Our previously published reports have described an effective biocontrol agent named Pseudomonas sp. M18 as its 16S rDNA sequence and several regulator genes share homologous sequences with those of P. aeruginosa, but there are several unusual phenotypic features. This study aims to explore its strain specific genomic features and gene expression patterns at different temperatures.;The complete M18 genome is composed of a single chromosome of 6,327,754 base pairs containing 5684 open reading frames. Seven genomic islands, including two novel prophages and five specific non-phage islands were identified besides the conserved P. aeruginosa core genome. Each prophage contains a putative chitinase coding gene, and the prophage II contains a capB gene encoding a putative cold stress protein. The non-phage genomic islands contain genes responsible for pyoluteorin biosynthesis, environmental substance degradation and type I and III restriction-modification systems. Compared with other P. aeruginosa strains, the fewest number (3) of insertion sequences and the most number (3) of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats in M18 genome may contribute to the relative genome stability. Although the M18 genome is most closely related to that of P. aeruginosa strain LESB58, the strain M18 is more susceptible to several antimicrobial agents and easier to be erased in a mouse acute lung infection model than the strain LESB58. The whole M18 transcriptomic analysis indicated that 10.6% of the expressed genes are temperature-dependent, with 22 genes up-regulated at 28°C in three non-phage genomic islands and one prophage but none at 37°C.;The P. aeruginosa strain M18 has evolved its specific genomic structures and temperature dependent expression patterns to meet the requirement of its fitness and competitiveness under selective pressures imposed on the strain in rhizosphere niche.	12		438	10.1186/1471-2164-12-438	Wu;Ye;Ou;Wei;Huang;He;Xu	Da-Qiang;Jing;Hong-Yu;Xue;Xianqing;Ya-Wen;Yuquan	State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200240, PR China.	eng	Microb Drug Resist. 1998 Winter;4(4):257-61;J Bacteriol. 1999 Apr;181(7):2166-74;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009 Jan;22(1):161-82, Table of Contents;J Gen Microbiol. 1992 Dec;138(12):2475-83;Lancet. 1996 Sep 7;348(9028):639-42;Science. 2008 Dec 19;322(5909):1843-5;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jun 1;30(11):2478-83;Gene. 2006 Jul 5;376(1):68-78;Curr Microbiol. 2003 May;46(5):324-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jan;36(Database issue):D539-42;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jul 31;98(16):9342-7;Bioresour Technol. 2010 May;101(10):3649-56;Microbiology. 2007 Jan;153(Pt 1):16-28;J Bacteriol. 2010 Feb;192(4):1113-21;Curr Microbiol. 2009 Dec;59(6):621-7;J Bacteriol. 2008 Nov;190(21):7130-40;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Infect Immun. 2010 Apr;78(4):1437-46;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Jul;35(Web Server issue):W97-W104;Curr Microbiol. 2008 Apr;56(4):339-45;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Nat Cell Biol. 2007 Jul;9(7):797-803;Mol Microbiol. 1997 Jan;23(2):345-54;BMC Bioinformatics. 2004 Dec 15;5:198;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 May 24;91(11):5119-23;Crit Rev Biotechnol. 2007 Jan-Mar;27(1):21-8;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1986 Mar;29(3):488-95;Genome Biol. 2009;10(5):R51;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;Genome Biol. 2000;1(6):REVIEWS3003;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;J Bacteriol. 1988 Aug;170(8):3499-508;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jan 1;30(1):281-3;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Dec 1;27(23):4636-41;OMICS. 2005 Summer;9(2):146-59;J Bacteriol. 2002 Jul;184(13):3614-22;Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2006;44:417-45;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2004 Mar 19;232(2):197-202;Bioresour Technol. 2010 Jun;101(11):4089-95;Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Jul;38(Web Server issue):W194-200;Infect Immun. 1996 Feb;64(2):518-23;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Jul;35(Web Server issue):W52-7;Sci China C Life Sci. 2008 Feb;51(2):174-81;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 8;100(14):8484-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Sep 15;29(18):3742-56;J Bacteriol. 2009 Aug;191(15):5020-1;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1995 Sep;39(9):1948-53;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jan;37(Database issue):D483-8;Science. 2008 Aug 15;321(5891):960-4;Environ Microbiol. 2006 Jun;8(6):1095-104;Protein Sci. 2003 Aug;12(8):1652-62;Mol Microbiol. 1996 Aug;21(4):713-24;Can J Microbiol. 2003 Feb;49(2):85-91;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 24;101(8):2530-5;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2009 Oct;75(20):6568-80;Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2010 Jan;8(1):71-93;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2009 Jan;75(2):504-13;PLoS One. 2011;6(4):e19413;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2010 May;86(6):1761-73;Trends Microbiol. 2006 Sep;14(9):413-20;Curr Microbiol. 2007 Feb;54(2):97-101;PLoS One. 2010;5(1):e8842;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2004 Aug 1;237(1):41-7;J Appl Microbiol. 2005;98(1):145-54;Bioinformatics. 2005 Mar 1;21(5):617-23;Mol Biol Evol. 2007 Aug;24(8):1596-9;J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(8):2804-13;Bioinformatics. 2007 Nov 1;23(21):2947-8;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1996 Mar;62(3):865-71	MEDLINE	epublish

Phages could be an important alternative to antibiotics, especially for treatment of multiresistant bacteria as e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For an effective use of bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents, it is important to understand phage biology but also genes of the bacterial host essential for phage infection.;We isolated and characterized a lytic Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage, named JG004, and sequenced its genome. Phage JG004 is a lipopolysaccharide specific broad-host-range phage of the Myoviridae phage family. The genome of phage JG004 encodes twelve tRNAs and is highly related to the PAK-P1 phage genome. To investigate phage biology and phage-host interactions, we used transposon mutagenesis of the P. aeruginosa host and identified P. aeruginosa genes, which are essential for phage infection. Analysis of the respective P. aeruginosa mutants revealed several characteristics, such as host receptor and possible spermidine-dependance of phage JG004.;Whole genome sequencing of phage JG004 in combination with identification of P. aeruginosa host genes essential for infection, allowed insights into JG004 biology, revealed possible resistance mechanisms of the host bacterium such as mutations in LPS and spermidine biosynthesis and can also be used to characterize unknown gene products in P. aeruginosa.	11		102	10.1186/1471-2180-11-102	Garbe;Bunk;Rohde;Schobert	Julia;Boyke;Manfred;Max	Institute of Microbiology, Technische Universität Braunschweig, Spielmannstr. 7, 38106 Braunschweig, Germany.	eng	Curr Microbiol. 2009 Sep;59(3):274-81;J Bacteriol. 2006 Oct;188(19):6924-31;Nature. 1989 Aug 10;340(6233):467-8;J Bacteriol. 2008 Mar;190(6):1857-65;J Bacteriol. 2005 May;187(9):3188-200;J Med Microbiol. 2009 Sep;58(Pt 9):1133-48;Cell. 2003 Apr 18;113(2):141;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104;BMC Microbiol. 2009;9:224;J Bacteriol. 2000 Sep;182(18):5114-20;J Bacteriol. 2009 Nov;191(21):6618-31;Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2000 Nov;56(Pt 11):1501-4;Virology. 1994 Mar;199(2):301-10;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Environ Microbiol. 2007 Jul;9(7):1675-95;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2001;55:437-51;Genet Res. 1971 Oct;18(2):185-97;Mol Microbiol. 2000 Jan;35(2):324-40;J Bacteriol. 1994 Jun;176(12):3500-7;Environ Microbiol. 2009 May;11(5):1303-13;J Bacteriol. 2008 Mar;190(6):1966-75;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W526-31;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2009 Sep;64 Suppl 1:i29-36;Innate Immun. 2009 Oct;15(5):261-312;Science. 1995 Jun 30;268(5219):1899-902;Annu Rev Genet. 2008;42:647-81;Curr Microbiol. 2009 Aug;59(2):173-80;J Bacteriol. 2005 May;187(9):3002-12;Genome Biol. 2007;8(2):R22;Trends Microbiol. 2000 Mar;8(3):120-8;Trends Microbiol. 2005 Jun;13(6):278-84;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Jan;55(2):368-80;Mol Microbiol. 1998 May;28(3):449-61;Microbiol Immunol. 2009 May;53(5):301-4;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2874-83;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Oct 1;27(19):3911-20;Microbiol Rev. 1996 Sep;60(3):539-74;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2005 Aug;8(4):451-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Apr 5;102(14):5174-9;Proc Int Conf Intell Syst Mol Biol. 1994;2:28-36;Virology. 2009 Aug 15;391(1):1-4;Bioinformatics. 2003 Oct 12;19(15):1964-71;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Jun;48(6):1511-24;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Sep 15;90(18):8377-81;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jan 1;31(1):28-33;Can J Microbiol. 1999 Sep;45(9):791-6;Bioinformatics. 2005 Nov 15;21(22):4187-9;BMC Microbiol. 2010;10:301;J Bacteriol. 2003 Sep;185(17):5220-33;Genome Res. 2004 Jul;14(7):1394-403;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1993 Jan;59(1):208-12;Bioinformatics. 2007 Nov 1;23(21):2947-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Int J Med Microbiol. 2006 Feb;296(1):5-14;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):883-97;J Mol Biol. 2008 Oct 17;382(4):1031-42;Arch Virol. 2007 Feb;152(2):227-43	MEDLINE	epublish

U.S.A.	1091-6490	Evolutionary dynamics of bacteria in a human host environment.	Laboratory evolution experiments have led to important findings relating organism adaptation and genomic evolution. However, continuous monitoring of long-term evolution has been lacking for natural systems, limiting our understanding of these processes in situ. Here we characterize the evolutionary dynamics of a lineage of a clinically important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as it adapts to the airways of several individual cystic fibrosis patients over 200,000 bacterial generations, and provide estimates of mutation rates of bacteria in a natural environment. In contrast to predictions based on in vitro evolution experiments, we document limited diversification of the evolving lineage despite a highly structured and complex host environment. Notably, the lineage went through an initial period of rapid adaptation caused by a small number of mutations with pleiotropic effects, followed by a period of genetic drift with limited phenotypic change and a genomic signature of negative selection, suggesting that the evolving lineage has reached a major adaptive peak in the fitness landscape. This contrasts with previous findings of continued positive selection from long-term in vitro evolution experiments. The evolved phenotype of the infecting bacteria further suggests that the opportunistic pathogen has transitioned to become a primary pathogen for cystic fibrosis patients.	108	18	7481-6	10.1073/pnas.1018249108	Yang;Jelsbak;Marvig;Damkiær;Workman;Rau;Hansen;Folkesson;Johansen;Ciofu;Høiby;Sommer;Molin	Lei;Lars;Rasmus Lykke;Søren;Christopher T;Martin Holm;Susse Kirkelund;Anders;Helle Krogh;Oana;Niels;Morten O A;Søren	Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark, 2800 Lyngby, Denmark.	eng	Science. 2005 Sep 9;309(5741):1728-32;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Jun;49(6):2276-82;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8305-6;Nat Genet. 2006 Dec;38(12):1406-12;Nature. 2007 Feb 1;445(7127):533-6;Infect Immun. 2007 May;75(5):2214-24;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 8;104(19):8101-6;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Apr;64(2):512-33;PLoS Genet. 2008 Jan;4(1):e2;J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(8):2767-76;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2008 May;61(5):1053-6;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Aug 26;105(34):12503-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jan;37(Database issue):D483-8;Genome Biol. 2009;10(3):R25;Bioinformatics. 2009 Aug 15;25(16):2078-9;Nature. 2009 Oct 29;461(7268):1243-7;Infect Immun. 2009 Dec;77(12):5631-9;Environ Microbiol. 2010 Jun;12(6):1643-58;MBio. 2010;1(4). pii: e00199-10. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00199-10;Clin Microbiol Infect. 2011 May;17(5):704-11;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Oct 26;96(22):12638-43;Science. 2000 May 19;288(5469):1251-4;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Nature. 2000 Oct 12;407(6805):762-4;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2002 Apr;15(2):194-222;Gene. 2002 May 1;289(1-2):131-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Feb 4;100(3):1072-7;Nat Rev Genet. 2003 Jun;4(6):457-69;EMBO J. 2003 Aug 1;22(15):3803-15;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Nov;50(3):809-24;Genome Biol. 2004;5(2):R12;Genome Biol. 2004;5(10):R80;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Apr;85(8):2709-13;J Antimicrob Chemother. 1990 Apr;25(4):513-23;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Aug 15;88(16):7160-4;Science. 1993 Mar 19;259(5102):1757-60;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Sep 15;90(18):8377-81;Genetics. 1994 Mar;136(3):721-30;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1994 Sep;38(9):1944-52;J Med Microbiol. 1996 Aug;45(2):110-9;Electrophoresis. 1998 Apr;19(4):545-50;Nature. 1998 Jul 2;394(6688):69-72;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Nov 23;101(47):16630-5;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92	MEDLINE	ppublish

Multidrug-resistant bacteria are the cause of an increasing number of deadly pulmonary infections. Because there is currently a paucity of novel antibiotics, phage therapy--the use of specific viruses that infect bacteria--is now more frequently being considered as a potential treatment for bacterial infections. Using a mouse lung-infection model caused by a multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa mucoid strain isolated from a cystic fibrosis patient, we evaluated bacteriophage treatments. New bacteriophages were isolated from environmental samples and characterized. Bacteria and bacteriophages were applied intranasally to the immunocompetent mice. Survival was monitored and bronchoalveolar fluids were analysed. Quantification of bacteria, bacteriophages, pro-inflammatory and cytotoxicity markers, as well as histology and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed. A curative treatment (one single dose) administrated 2 h after the onset of the infection allowed over 95% survival. A four-day preventive treatment (one single dose) resulted in a 100% survival. All of the parameters measured correlated with the efficacy of both curative and preventive bacteriophage treatments. We also showed that in vitro optimization of a bacteriophage towards a clinical strain improved both its efficacy on in vivo treatments and its host range on a panel of 20 P. aeruginosa cystic fibrosis strains. This work provides an incentive to develop clinical studies on pulmonary bacteriophage therapy to combat multidrug-resistant lung infections.	6	2	e16963	10.1371/journal.pone.0016963	Morello;Saussereau;Maura;Huerre;Touqui;Debarbieux	Eric;Emilie;Damien;Michel;Lhousseine;Laurent	Molecular Biology of the Gene in Extremophiles Unit, Department of Microbiology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.	eng	Methods Mol Biol. 2009;502:227-38;Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2008 Nov;32 Suppl 1:S2-9;Trends Microbiol. 2009 Feb;17(2):66-72;Clin Exp Med. 2009 Jun;9(2):93-100;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2009 Jul;33(4):801-19;J Immunol. 2009 Jul 1;183(1):670-6;Curr Opin Investig Drugs. 2009 Aug;10(8):766-74;Clin Otolaryngol. 2009 Aug;34(4):349-57;PLoS One. 2009;4(10):e7370;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2010 Jan;54(1):397-404;J Infect Dis. 2010 Jan 15;201(2):264-71;J Infect Dis. 2010 Apr 1;201(7):1096-104;J Appl Microbiol. 2010 Feb;108(2):695-702;Clin Infect Dis. 2010 Aug 1;51 Suppl 1:S81-7;Lancet Infect Dis. 2010 Sep;10(9):597-602;Eur Respir J. 2010 Nov;36(5):1120-30;Trends Biotechnol. 2010 Dec;28(12):591-5;Infect Immun. 1999 Nov;67(11):6164-7;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2001;55:437-51;J Clin Microbiol. 2003 May;41(5):2266-7;Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2003 Jun;2(6):489-97;Expert Rev Vaccines. 2004 Aug;3(4):463-76;Infect Immun. 2004 Aug;72(8):4741-50;J Gen Microbiol. 1983 Aug;129(8):2659-75;Nature. 1989 Aug 10;340(6233):467-8;Microbiology. 1996 Oct;142 ( Pt 10):2785-93;Virus Res. 2005 Jun;110(1-2):1-8;J Immunol. 2005 Sep 15;175(6):3927-34;Curr Opin Pharmacol. 2007 Jun;7(3):244-51;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2007 Oct;10(5):436-40;J Microbiol Methods. 2008 Aug;74(2-3):114-8;Med Mal Infect. 2008 Aug;38(8):426-30;Methods Mol Biol. 2009;501:113-26	MEDLINE	epublish

We describe a deep-sequencing procedure for tracking large numbers of transposon mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The procedure employs a new Tn-seq methodology based on the generation and amplification of single-strand circles carrying transposon junction sequences (the Tn-seq circle method), a method which can be used with virtually any transposon. The procedure reliably identified more than 100,000 transposon insertions in a single experiment, providing near-saturation coverage of the genome. To test the effectiveness of the procedure for mutant identification, we screened for mutations reducing intrinsic resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin. Intrinsic tobramycin resistance had been previously analyzed at genome scale using mutant-by-mutant screening and thus provided a benchmark for evaluating the new method. The new Tn-seq procedure identified 117 tobramycin resistance genes, the majority of which were then verified with individual mutants. The group of genes with the strongest mutant phenotypes included nearly all (13 of 14) of those with strong mutant phenotypes identified in the previous screening, as well as a nearly equal number of new genes. The results thus show the effectiveness of the Tn-seq method in defining the genetic basis of a complex resistance trait of P. aeruginosa and indicate that it can be used to analyze a variety of growth-related processes.	2	1	e00315-10	10.1128/mBio.00315-10	Gallagher;Shendure;Manoil	Larry A;Jay;Colin	Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.	eng	Annu Rev Microbiol. 1999;53:129-54;J Bacteriol. 2010 Jun;192(12):3001-10;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Nov 25;100(24):14339-44;Gene. 1998 May 28;212(1):77-86;EMBO J. 1998 Jul 15;17(14):3968-80;Biochim Biophys Acta. 2004 Nov 11;1694(1-3):121-34;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2005 Sep;29(4):703-17;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2006 May;4(5):383-94;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007;35(7):e47;Trends Biotechnol. 2007 Dec;25(12):547-55;Genome Res. 2008 Nov;18(11):1851-8;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Apr;72(1):183-201;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Aug 25;106(34):14570-5;Cell Host Microbe. 2009 Sep 17;6(3):279-89;Nat Methods. 2009 Oct;6(10):767-72;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Sep 22;106(38):16422-7;J Hosp Infect. 2009 Dec;73(4):338-44;Genome Res. 2009 Dec;19(12):2308-16;Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2009 Dec;73(12):2698-704;J Bacteriol. 2002 Dec;184(23):6472-80	MEDLINE	epublish

Microbiol.	1098-660X	Genetic characterization indicates that a specific subpopulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is associated with keratitis infections.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common opportunistic bacterial pathogen that causes a variety of infections in humans. Populations of P. aeruginosa are dominated by common clones that can be isolated from diverse clinical and environmental sources. To determine whether specific clones are associated with corneal infection, we used a portable genotyping microarray system to analyze a set of 63 P. aeruginosa isolates from patients with corneal ulcers (keratitis). We then used population analysis to compare the keratitis isolates to a wider collection of P. aeruginosa from various nonocular sources. We identified various markers in a subpopulation of P. aeruginosa associated with keratitis that were in strong disequilibrium with the wider P. aeruginosa population, including oriC, exoU, katN, unmodified flagellin, and the carriage of common genomic islands. The genome sequencing of a keratitis isolate (39016; representing the dominant serotype O11), which was associated with a prolonged clinical healing time, revealed several genomic islands and prophages within the accessory genome. The PCR amplification screening of all 63 keratitis isolates, however, provided little evidence for the shared carriage of specific prophages or genomic islands between serotypes. P. aeruginosa twitching motility, due to type IV pili, is implicated in corneal virulence. We demonstrated that 46% of the O11 keratitis isolates, including 39016, carry a distinctive pilA, encoding the pilin of type IV pili. Thus, the keratitis isolates were associated with specific characteristics, indicating that a subpopulation of P. aeruginosa is adapted to cause corneal infection.	49	3	993-1003	10.1128/JCM.02036-10	Stewart;Wiehlmann;Ashelford;Preston;Frimmersdorf;Campbell;Neal;Hall;Tuft;Kaye;Winstanley	Rosalind M K;Lutz;Kevin E;Stephanie J;Eliane;Barry J;Timothy J;Neil;Stephen;Stephen B;Craig	Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, Duncan Building, Daulby Street, Liverpool, L69 3GA, United Kingdom.	eng	Infect Immun. 2001 Nov;69(11):6962-9;Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2010 Aug;51(8):4151-5;Eye (Lond). 2002 Sep;16(5):608-18;Clin Exp Optom. 2002 Sep;85(5):271-8;J Bacteriol. 2002 Dec;184(23):6665-80;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):898-911;J Bacteriol. 2003 Feb;185(4):1316-25;Br J Ophthalmol. 1999 Sep;83(9):1027-31;Microbes Infect. 2000 Jul;2(9):1051-60;J Bacteriol. 2000 Nov;182(21):6066-74;J Bacteriol. 2001 Feb;183(3):843-53;Infect Immun. 2001 Aug;69(8):4931-7;Infect Immun. 2001 Oct;69(10):6284-95;J Clin Microbiol. 2003 Mar;41(3):1192-202;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 8;100(14):8484-9;J Infect Dis. 2003 Aug 15;188(4):512-8;Infect Immun. 2003 Sep;71(9):5389-93;Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2003 Sep;44(9):3892-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 24;101(8):2530-5;J Bacteriol. 2004 Apr;186(7):2115-22;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2004 Feb;2(2):123-40;J Bacteriol. 2004 May;186(10):3270-3;Microbiology. 2004 May;150(Pt 5):1315-26;J Bacteriol. 2004 Oct;186(19):6560-74;J Bacteriol. 1983 Jul;155(1):203-12;Cornea. 1990 Apr;9(2):161-9;J Mol Biol. 1991 Mar 20;218(2):349-64;J Clin Microbiol. 1997 Jun;35(6):1295-9;Mol Microbiol. 1997 Jun;24(6):1249-62;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Dec 15;25(24):4876-82;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Dec;42(12):5644-9;J Med Microbiol. 2005 Jun;54(Pt 6):519-26;Environ Microbiol. 2005 Jul;7(7):969-80;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(3):1184-7;Curr Eye Res. 2006 Apr;31(4):297-306;J Med Microbiol. 2006 Jun;55(Pt 6):677-88;J Bacteriol. 2006 Jun;188(11):4037-50;Cell Microbiol. 2006 Nov;8(11):1707-19;Genetics. 2006 Oct;174(2):1041-56;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;J Bacteriol. 2007 Mar;189(6):2443-59;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 8;104(19):8101-6;Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2007 Apr;20(2):129-41;Microbiology. 2007 Sep;153(Pt 9):2885-95;Int J Med Microbiol. 2007 Nov;297(7-8):615-23;J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2007 Aug;17(8):1344-52;Exp Eye Res. 2007 Dec;85(6):799-805;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;Genomics. 2008 Jun;91(6):530-7;Microbiology. 2008 Aug;154(Pt 8):2184-94;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 Oct;74(20):6194-205;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2009 Jan;290(1):70-8;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2008 Dec;289(1):1-12;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Jun;53(6):2522-31;Thorax. 2009 Jun;64(6):535-40;J Antimicrob Chemother. 2009 Sep;64(3):454-89;J Infect Dis. 2009 Dec 15;200(12):1928-35;PLoS One. 2009;4(11):e7740;Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2010 Jan;51(1):362-8;PLoS One. 2010;5(1):e8842;Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2010 May;51(5):2519-24;Br Med Bull. 2002;61:81-96	MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important pathogen in cystic fibrosis patients, and a model organism for the study of nosocomially acquired infections, biofilms and intrinsic multidrug resistance. In this study we characterize ϕPA3, a new generalized transducing bacteriophage for P. aeruginosa. ϕPA3 transduced chromosomal mutations between PAO1 strains, and infected multiple P. aeruginosa clinical isolates as well as the P. aeruginosa model laboratory strains PAK and PA14. Electron microscopy imaging was used to classify ϕPA3 in the order Caudovirales and the family Myoviridae. The genome of ϕPA3 was sequenced and found to contain 309,208 bp, the second-largest bacteriophage currently deposited in GenBank. The genome contains 378 ORFs and five tRNAs. Many ORF products in the ϕPA3 genome are similar to proteins encoded by P. aeruginosa phage ϕKZ and Pseudomonas chlororaphis phage 201ϕ2-1, and so ϕPA3 was classified genetically as a member of the ϕKZ-like group of phages. This is the first report of a member of this group of phages acting as a generalized transducer. Given its wide host range, high transduction efficiency and large genome size, the 'jumbo' phage ϕPA3 could be a powerful tool in functional genomic analysis of diverse P. aeruginosa strains of fundamental and clinical importance.	157	Pt 3	859-67	10.1099/mic.0.044701-0	Monson;Foulds;Foweraker;Welch;Salmond	Rita;Ian;Juliet;Martin;George P C	Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1QW, UK.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes lung infections in patients suffering from the genetic disorder Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Once a chronic lung infection is established, P. aeruginosa cannot be eradicated by antibiotic treatment. Phage therapy is an alternative to treat these chronic P. aeruginosa infections. However, little is known about the factors which influence phage infection of P. aeruginosa under infection conditions and suitable broad host range phages.;We isolated and characterized a phage, named JG024, which infects a broad range of clinical and environmental P. aeruginosa strains. Sequencing of the phage genome revealed that the phage JG024 is highly related to the ubiquitous and conserved PB1-like phages. The receptor of phage JG024 was determined as lipopolysaccharide. We used an artificial sputum medium to study phage infection under conditions similar to a chronic lung infection. Alginate production was identified as a factor reducing phage infectivity.;Phage JG024 is a suitable broad host range phage which could be used in phage therapy. Phage infection experiments under simulated chronic lung infection conditions showed that alginate production reduces phage infection efficiency.	10		301	10.1186/1471-2180-10-301	Garbe;Wesche;Bunk;Kazmierczak;Selezska;Rohde;Sikorski;Rohde;Jahn;Schobert	Julia;Andrea;Boyke;Marlon;Katherina;Christine;Johannes;Manfred;Dieter;Max	Institute of Microbiology, Technische Universität Braunschweig, Spielmannstr, 7, 38106 Braunschweig, Germany.	eng	Clin Microbiol Rev. 2006 Apr;19(2):403-34;J Bacteriol. 2005 Aug;187(15):5267-77;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2005 Jun 1;171(11):1209-23;J Mol Biol. 2000 Aug 4;301(1):27-33;Mol Microbiol. 1995 May;16(3):565-74;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 8;104(19):8101-6;Science. 1989 Sep 8;245(4922):1066-73;J Bacteriol. 2000 Sep;182(18):5114-20;Methods Enzymol. 2001;336:302-14;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Nov 28;103(48):18131-6;Genet Mol Res. 2003;2(1):48-62;Trends Mol Med. 2008 Mar;14(3):120-33;Trends Microbiol. 2009 Mar;17(3):130-8;Genet Res. 1971 Oct;18(2):185-97;Mol Microbiol. 2000 Jan;35(2):324-40;J Bacteriol. 1994 Jun;176(12):3500-7;Infect Immun. 1981 Jul;33(1):142-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W526-31;Folia Microbiol (Praha). 1994;39(4):337-41;Innate Immun. 2009 Oct;15(5):261-312;PLoS One. 2009;4(3):e4944;Science. 1995 Jun 30;268(5219):1899-902;Curr Microbiol. 2009 Aug;59(2):173-80;J Med Microbiol. 2005 Jul;54(Pt 7):667-76;J Bacteriol. 2004 May;186(10):3270-3;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Nov;11(11):2874-83;J Infect Dis. 2005 Aug 1;192(3):410-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Oct 1;27(19):3911-20;Cell Microbiol. 2009 Feb;11(2):208-16;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001 Mar;45(3):649-59;Proc Int Conf Intell Syst Mol Biol. 1994;2:28-36;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2004 Feb;2(2):166-73;Microbiology. 2010 Jul;156(Pt 7):2239-52;Bioinformatics. 2003 Oct 12;19(15):1964-71;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Jun;48(6):1511-24;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Sep 15;90(18):8377-81;J Virol. 1977 Sep;23(3):461-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jan 1;31(1):28-33;Nature. 2000 Oct 12;407(6805):762-4;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2002 Apr;15(2):194-222;Trends Microbiol. 2001 Jan;9(1):34-9;Bioinformatics. 2005 Nov 15;21(22):4187-9;Arch Virol. 1993;131(1-2):141-51;Genome Res. 2004 Jul;14(7):1394-403;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1993 Jan;59(1):208-12;Bioinformatics. 2007 Nov 1;23(21):2947-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Int J Med Microbiol. 2006 Feb;296(1):5-14;Arch Virol. 2007 Feb;152(2):227-43	MEDLINE	epublish

We present a detailed analysis of the genome architecture, structural proteome and infection-related properties of three Pseudomonas phages, designated LUZ7, LIT1 and PEV2. These podoviruses encapsulate 72.5 to 74.9 kb genomes and lyse their host after 25 min aerobic infection. PEV2 can successfully infect under anaerobic conditions, but its latent period is tripled, the lysis proceeds far slower and the burst size decreases significantly. While the overall genome structure of these phages resembles the well-studied coliphage N4, these Pseudomonas phages encode a cluster of tail genes which displays significant similarity to a Pseudomonasaeruginosa (cryptic) prophage region. Using ESI-MS/MS, these tail proteins were shown to be part of the phage particle, as well as ten other proteins including a giant 370 kDa virion RNA polymerase. These phages are the first described representatives of a novel kind of obligatory lytic P. aeruginosa-infecting phages, belonging to the widespread N4-like viruses genus.	405	1	26-30	10.1016/j.virol.2010.06.011	Ceyssens;Brabban;Rogge;Lewis;Pickard;Goulding;Dougan;Noben;Kropinski;Kutter;Lavigne	Pieter-Jan;Andrew;Larissa;Matthew Spooner;Derek;David;Gordon;Jean-Paul;Andrew;Elizabeth;Rob	Division of Gene Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg, Leuven, B-3001, Belgium.	eng	Pediatr Pulmonol. 2000 Aug;30(2):79-85;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Aug;11(8):2055-64;EMBO J. 2002 Nov 1;21(21):5815-23;Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2002 Dec 5;54(11):1425-43;Genes Dev. 2003 Sep 15;17(18):2334-45;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Feb;51(4):1169-83;J Virol. 1974 Jan;13(1):186-96;Comput Appl Biosci. 1988 Mar;4(1):11-7;J Mol Biol. 1988 Jul 5;202(1):1-10;Cell. 1992 Aug 7;70(3):491-500;Science. 1997 Mar 14;275(5306):1655-7;Microbiology. 2006 Feb;152(Pt 2):529-34;Infect Immun. 2006 Jul;74(7):4237-45;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2006 Sep;72(9):6405-10;J Mol Biol. 2007 Feb 16;366(2):406-19;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Apr 24;104(17):7033-8;Trends Microbiol. 2007 Dec;15(12):530-7;J Bacteriol. 2008 Feb;190(4):1429-35;J Mol Biol. 2008 May 2;378(3):726-36;Res Microbiol. 2008 Jun;159(5):406-14;Mol Cell. 2008 Dec 5;32(5):707-17;Environ Microbiol. 2009 May;11(5):1303-13;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2001;55:21-48	MEDLINE	ppublish

The EPIC Observational Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study investigating risk factors for and clinical outcomes associated with early Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) acquisition in young children with cystic fibrosis (CF).;To describe the baseline characteristics of the cohort and evaluate associations between potential risk factors and nutritional and respiratory characteristics at enrollment. We hypothesized that distinct demographic and environmental risk factors could be identified for poorer nutritional status and lung function at enrollment.;During 2004-2006, 1,700 children with CF were enrolled at 59 US CF centers. Children <or=12 years were eligible if they had no prior Pa infection (Pa-Never) or, if prior isolation of Pa from respiratory cultures, at least a 2-year history of Pa negative cultures (Pa-Past).;One thousand one hundred seventeen participants (65.7%) were Pa-Never and 583 (34.3%) Pa-Past. Pa-never patients had a lower proportion of CFTR genotypes with both mutations in functional classes I, II, or III), higher lung function and less respiratory symptoms. Diagnosis after newborn or prenatal screening was associated with significantly higher mean weight, height, and FEV(1) at enrollment, while maternal smoking during pregnancy appeared to worsen these parameters.;Children in this cohort with a remote history of Pa infection had a higher proportion of CFTR genotypes associated with severely reduced CFTR function as well as lower lung function and more respiratory symptoms than those without prior Pa infection. These observed differences in respiratory indices may reflect the impact of prior Pa airway infection and/or of CFTR genotype or other genetic factors predisposing both to earlier Pa acquisition and more severe lung disease. Key characteristics associated with nutritional and pulmonary status at enrollment included diagnosis after prenatal or neonatal screening (protective) and in utero cigarette exposure (harmful).	45	9	934-44	10.1002/ppul.21279	Rosenfeld;Emerson;McNamara;Joubran;Retsch-Bogart;Graff;Gutierrez;Kanga;Lahiri;Noyes;Ramsey;Ren;Schechter;Morgan;Gibson	Margaret;Julia;Sharon;Kelli;George;Gavin R;Hector H;Jamshed F;Thomas;Blake;Bonnie;Clement L;Michael;Wayne;Ronald L	Department of Pediatrics, Seattle Children's Hospital and University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA. margaret.rosenfeld@seattlechildrens.org	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

The ability of bacterial plasmids to adapt to novel hosts and thereby shift their host range is key to their long-term persistence in bacterial communities. Promiscuous plasmids of the incompatibility group P (IncP)-1 can colonize a wide range of hosts, but it is not known if and how they can contract, shift or further expand their host range. To understand the evolutionary mechanisms of host range shifts of IncP-1 plasmids, an IncP-1β mini-replicon was experimentally evolved in four hosts in which it was initially unstable. After 1000 generations in serial batch cultures under antibiotic selection for plasmid maintenance (kanamycin resistance), the stability of the mini-plasmid dramatically improved in all coevolved hosts. However, only plasmids evolved in Shewanella oneidensis showed improved stability in the ancestor, indicating that adaptive mutations had occurred in the plasmid itself. Complete genome sequence analysis of nine independently evolved plasmids showed seven unique plasmid genotypes that had various kinds of single mutations at one locus, namely, the N-terminal region of the replication initiation protein TrfA. Such parallel evolution indicates that this region was under strong selection. In five of the seven evolved plasmids, these trfA mutations resulted in a significantly higher plasmid copy number. Evolved plasmids were found to be stable in four other naive hosts, but could no longer replicate in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study shows that plasmids can specialize to a novel host through trade-offs between improved stability in the new host and the ability to replicate in a previously permissive host.	4	12	1568-80	10.1038/ismej.2010.72	Sota;Yano;Hughes;Daughdrill;Abdo;Forney;Top	Masahiro;Hirokazu;Julie M;Gary W;Zaid;Larry J;Eva M	Department of Biological Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, USA.	eng	Genetics. 2004 May;167(1):9-20;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jul 1;32(Web Server issue):W321-6;J Bacteriol. 2004 Nov;186(21):7161-74;J Mol Biol. 1982 Dec 15;162(3):699-703;J Infect Dis. 1984 Mar;149(3):320-9;J Mol Biol. 1984 May 25;175(3):229-49;Nucleic Acids Res. 1988 Jan 11;16(1):358;Plasmid. 1987 Sep;18(2):164-9;Nature. 1988 Sep 22;335(6188):351-2;J Bacteriol. 1990 Jul;172(7):3859-67;J Mol Biol. 1990 Jul 5;214(1):171-82;J Bacteriol. 1991 Sep;173(18):5861-8;Genetica. 1991;84(3):195-202;J Bacteriol. 1992 Jun;174(12):4110-9;J Bacteriol. 1994 Jun;176(11):3140-7;J Mol Biol. 1994 Jun 24;239(5):623-63;Genetics. 2000 Aug;155(4):1505-19;EMBO J. 2001 Jun 15;20(12):3262-71;J Biol Chem. 2001 Jun 29;276(26):23639-44;J Bacteriol. 2001 Oct;183(19):5684-97;Science. 2001 Dec 14;294(5550):2317-23;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Oct;46(1):223-34;J Bacteriol. 2003 Feb;185(4):1367-75;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 22;100(15):8692-7;J Biol Chem. 2003 Nov 14;278(46):45305-10;Genetics. 2003 Dec;165(4):1641-9;J Mol Biol. 2004 May 14;338(5):1015-26;Mol Microbiol. 1994 Sep;13(5):855-61;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1995 May;61(5):1691-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Apr 16;93(8):3559-64;J Biol Chem. 1997 Dec 26;272(52):33312-8;J Mol Biol. 1998 Oct 9;282(5):969-90;Science. 1999 Jul 16;285(5426):422-4;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2004 Nov;70(11):6670-7;Nat Med. 2004 Dec;10(12 Suppl):S122-9;Genetica. 2005 Feb;123(1-2):157-70;Bioinformatics. 2005 Aug 15;21(16):3433-4;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2005 Sep;3(9):711-21;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2005 Sep;3(9):722-32;Biochemistry. 2005 Sep 20;44(37):12454-70;Genetics. 2006 Feb;172(2):751-7;J Microbiol Methods. 2006 Jun;65(3):476-87;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jun 13;103(24):9107-12;J Bacteriol. 2006 Aug;188(15):5501-9;Microbiology. 2006 Sep;152(Pt 9):2689-701;Biol Lett. 2005 Jun 22;1(2):250-2;Microbiology. 2006 Dec;152(Pt 12):3477-84;Microbiology. 2007 Feb;153(Pt 2):452-63;FEMS Microbiol Ecol. 2007 Mar;59(3):738-48;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007;35(4):1377-88;Genetics. 2000 Jan;154(1):27-37;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2007 Jul;31(4):449-77;Genetics. 2008 Apr;178(4):2179-90;FEMS Microbiol Ecol. 2008 Oct;66(1):3-13;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2009 Oct;22(4):664-89;Plasmid. 2010 Mar;63(2):98-107	MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriol.	1098-5530	The genetic basis of laboratory adaptation in Caulobacter crescentus.	The dimorphic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus has evolved marked phenotypic changes during its 50-year history of culture in the laboratory environment, providing an excellent system for the study of natural selection and phenotypic microevolution in prokaryotes. Combining whole-genome sequencing with classical molecular genetic tools, we have comprehensively mapped a set of polymorphisms underlying multiple derived phenotypes, several of which arose independently in separate strain lineages. The genetic basis of phenotypic differences in growth rate, mucoidy, adhesion, sedimentation, phage susceptibility, and stationary-phase survival between C. crescentus strain CB15 and its derivative NA1000 is determined by coding, regulatory, and insertion/deletion polymorphisms at five chromosomal loci. This study evidences multiple genetic mechanisms of bacterial evolution as driven by selection for growth and survival in a new selective environment and identifies a common polymorphic locus, zwf, between lab-adapted C. crescentus and clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that have adapted to a human host during chronic infection.	192	14	3678-88	10.1128/JB.00255-10	Marks;Castro-Rojas;Teiling;Du;Kapatral;Walunas;Crosson	Melissa E;Cyd Marie;Clotilde;Lei;Vinayak;Theresa L;Sean	Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chicago, 929 East 57th Street, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.	eng	J Bacteriol. 1977 Oct;132(1):294-301;Nature. 2009 Oct 29;461(7268):1243-7;J Bacteriol. 1991 Sep;173(17):5568-72;Microbiol Rev. 1981 Mar;45(1):123-79;Cell. 2006 Dec 29;127(7):1309-21;J Bacteriol. 2005 Nov;187(22):7561-8;FEBS Lett. 2007 Aug 7;581(20):3771-6;Annu Rev Biochem. 2006;75:39-68;Bioinformatics. 2009 Nov 15;25(22):3005-11;Environ Microbiol. 2009 May;11(5):1181-93;J Evol Biol. 2005 Nov;18(6):1376-86;Mol Ecol. 2008 Nov;17(21):4586-96;Trends Ecol Evol. 2009 May;24(5):263-70;Nature. 2008 Mar 13;452(7184):169-75;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jan;36(Database issue):D623-31;Biotechniques. 2002 Dec;33(6):1334-41;J Bacteriol. 2003 Feb;185(4):1432-42;Nature. 2009 Feb 12;457(7231):824-9;Dev Biol. 2009 Aug 1;332(1):36-47;Methods Enzymol. 1991;204:372-84;Nat Rev Genet. 2007 Sep;8(9):675-88;Nat Genet. 2005 Apr;37(4):441-4;BMC Evol Biol. 2007;7:126;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Mar 27;98(7):4136-41;J Bacteriol. 2008 Nov;190(21):7219-31;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1988 Aug;54(8):2078-85;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Dec;36(21):6688-719;J Bacteriol. 1986 Jul;167(1):66-72;Bacteriol Rev. 1964 Sep;28:231-95;Genome Res. 2004 Jul;14(7):1394-403;J Mol Evol. 2008 Oct;67(4):368-76;Genetics. 1977 Nov;87(3):391-9;Gene. 1987;57(2-3):239-46;J Mol Evol. 2003 Sep;57(3):241-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 15;104 Suppl 1:8641-8	MEDLINE	ppublish

The constant increase in development and spread of bacterial resistance to antibiotics poses a serious threat to human health. New sequencing technologies are now on the horizon that will yield massive increases in our capacity for DNA sequencing and will revolutionize the drug discovery process. Since essential genes are promising novel antibiotic targets, the prediction of gene essentiality based on genomic information has become a major focus.;In this study we demonstrate that pooled sequencing is applicable for the analysis of sequence variations of strain collections with more than 10 individual isolates. Pooled sequencing of 36 clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates revealed that essential and highly expressed proteins evolve at lower rates, whereas extracellular proteins evolve at higher rates. We furthermore refined the list of experimentally essential P. aeruginosa genes, and identified 980 genes that show no sequence variation at all. Among the conserved nonessential genes we found several that are involved in regulation, motility and virulence, indicating that they represent factors of evolutionary importance for the lifestyle of a successful environmental bacterium and opportunistic pathogen.;The detailed analysis of a comprehensive set of P. aeruginosa genomes in this study clearly disclosed detailed information of the genomic makeup and revealed a large set of highly conserved genes that play an important role for the lifestyle of this microorganism. Sequencing strain collections enables for a detailed and extensive identification of sequence variations as potential bacterial adaptation processes, e.g., during the development of antibiotic resistance in the clinical setting and thus may be the basis to uncover putative targets for novel treatment strategies.	11		234	10.1186/1471-2164-11-234	Dötsch;Klawonn;Jarek;Scharfe;Blöcker;Häussler	Andreas;Frank;Michael;Maren;Helmut;Susanne	Chronic Pseudomonas Infections Research Group, Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.	eng	J Mol Evol. 2006 Dec;63(6):733-46;J Bacteriol. 2006 Dec;188(24):8601-6;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Apr;64(2):512-33;Drugs R D. 2007;8(4):201-12;PLoS One. 2008;3(2):e1619;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;Biotechnol Lett. 2008 May;30(5):777-90;Methods Mol Biol. 2008;416:13-26;Methods Mol Med. 2008;142:1-9;Biochem Cell Biol. 2008 Apr;86(2):111-5;Cell. 2008 Jul 25;134(2):341-52;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2008 Dec;52(12):4486-91;BMC Evol Biol. 2008;8:313;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jan;37(Database issue):D483-8;J Cyst Fibros. 2009 Jan;8(1):66-70;Anim Health Res Rev. 2008 Dec;9(2):237-46;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;Curr Med Chem. 2009;16(1):42-65;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Jun;53(6):2522-31;Bioinformatics. 2009 Aug 15;25(16):2074-5;Genome Biol. 2008;9(4):R69;PLoS One. 2010;5(1):e8842;J Bacteriol. 2000 Jun;182(11):3125-35;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;J Bacteriol. 2001 Nov;183(21):6454-65;Genome Res. 2002 Jun;12(6):962-8;J Bacteriol. 2003 Feb;185(4):1316-25;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Nov 25;100(24):14339-44;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jan 1;32(Database issue):D271-2;Mol Biol Evol. 2004 Jan;21(1):108-16;Methods Mol Biol. 2004;266:231-59;Nucleic Acids Res. 1987 Feb 11;15(3):1281-95;Mol Biol Evol. 1994 Sep;11(5):725-36;Nat Biotechnol. 1998 Sep;16(9):851-6;Cell. 1999 Jan 8;96(1):47-56;In Silico Biol. 2004;4(3):355-60;BMC Bioinformatics. 2005;6:64;Mol Biol Evol. 2005 Nov;22(11):2147-56;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2006 Mar;30(2):274-91;Int J Med Microbiol. 2006 Apr;296(2-3):149-61;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Sep;61(5):1308-21;In Silico Biol. 2006;6(1-2):43-7;Mol Biol Evol. 2006 Nov;23(11):2039-48;BMC Genomics. 2006;7:265;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90	MEDLINE	epublish

Although new antibiotics are scarce, the use of bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, is rarely proposed as a means of offsetting this shortage. Doubt also remains widespread about the efficacy of phage therapy despite recent encouraging results. Using a bioluminescent Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, we monitored and quantified the efficacy of a bacteriophage treatment in mice during acute lung infection. Bacteriophage treatment not only was effective in saving animals from lethal infection, but also was able to prevent lung infection when given 24 h before bacterial infection, thereby extending the potential use of bacteriophages as therapeutic agents to combat bacterial lung infection.	201	7	1096-104	10.1086/651135	Debarbieux;Leduc;Maura;Morello;Criscuolo;Grossi;Balloy;Touqui	Laurent;Dominique;Damien;Eric;Alexis;Olivier;Viviane;Lhousseine	Molecular Biology of the Gene in Extremophiles Unit, Department of Microbiology, Institut Pasteur, 75724 Paris, France. laurent.debarbieux@pasteur.fr	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA7 is a non-respiratory human isolate from Argentina that is multiresistant to antibiotics. We first sequenced gyrA, gyrB, parC, parE, ampC, ampR, and several housekeeping genes and found that PA7 is a taxonomic outlier. We report here the complete sequence of the 6,588,339 bp genome, which has only about 95% overall identity to other strains. PA7 has multiple novel genomic islands and a total of 51 occupied regions of genomic plasticity. These islands include antibiotic resistance genes, parts of transposons, prophages, and a pKLC102-related island. Several PA7 genes not present in PAO1 or PA14 are putative orthologues of other Pseudomonas spp. and Ralstonia spp. genes. PA7 appears to be closely related to the known taxonomic outlier DSM1128 (ATCC9027). PA7 lacks several virulence factors, notably the entire TTSS region corresponding to PA1690-PA1725 of PAO1. It has neither exoS nor exoU and lacks toxA, exoT, and exoY. PA7 is serotype O12 and pyoverdin type II. Preliminary proteomic studies indicate numerous differences with PAO1, some of which are probably a consequence of a frameshift mutation in the mvfR quorum sensing regulatory gene.	5	1	e8842	10.1371/journal.pone.0008842	Roy;Tetu;Larouche;Elbourne;Tremblay;Ren;Dodson;Harkins;Shay;Watkins;Mahamoud;Paulsen	Paul H;Sasha G;André;Liam;Simon;Qinghu;Robert;Derek;Ryan;Kisha;Yasmin;Ian T	Département de biochimie et de microbiologie, and Centre de recherche en infectiologie, Université Laval, Québec, Québec, Canada.	eng	Genomics. 1999 Dec 15;62(3):500-7;Environ Microbiol. 2009 Aug;11(8):2123-35;FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 2000 Jul;28(3):241-5;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Apr;44(1):119-30;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jun 1;30(11):2478-83;J Bacteriol. 2002 Jul;184(13):3614-22;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Oct 1;99(20):13148-53;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 8;100(14):8484-9;Microbiology. 2004 Apr;150(Pt 4):831-41;Genome Res. 2004 Jul;14(7):1394-403;Nature. 1990 Jun 21;345(6277):739-43;J Bacteriol. 1992 May;174(10):3196-203;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1992 Oct 15;76(3):267-73;Nucleic Acids Res. 1994 Jun 11;22(11):2071-8;Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 1996 Jun;15(6):459-64;J Hosp Infect. 1997 Jun;36(2):105-16;Nature. 1997 Dec 11;390(6660):580-6;Microb Drug Resist. 1998 Winter;4(4):257-61;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1999 Mar;43(3):465-70;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Nov;42(11):5094-101;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Feb;55(4):998-1014;J Bacteriol. 2005 Mar;187(6):2138-47;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jul;187(14):4908-20;J Bacteriol. 2005 Sep;187(18):6488-98;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Oct;58(2):552-64;J Bacteriol. 2006 Jun;188(11):4037-50;J Bacteriol. 2007 Jan;189(1):151-9;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;Bioinformatics. 2007 Mar 15;23(6):673-9;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2007 Oct;275(2):244-9;J Bacteriol. 2007 Nov;189(21):7600-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jan;36(Database issue):D539-42;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jul 1;36(Web Server issue):W181-4;J Bacteriol. 2008 Nov;190(21):7130-40;J Bacteriol. 2008 Nov;190(22):7464-78;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jan;37(Database issue):D483-8;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Jun;53(6):2522-31;PLoS One. 2009;4(6):e6018;J Bacteriol. 2009 Jul;191(14):4534-45;J Bacteriol. 2000 Jun;182(11):3125-35	MEDLINE	epublish

Plant Microbe Interact.	0894-0282	Pseudomonas syringae strains naturally lacking the classical P. syringae hrp/hrc Locus are common leaf colonizers equipped with an atypical type III secretion system.	Pseudomonas syringae is best known as a plant pathogen that causes disease by translocating immune-suppressing effector proteins into plant cells through a type III secretion system (T3SS). However, P. syringae strains belonging to a newly described phylogenetic subgroup (group 2c) are missing the canonical P. syringae hrp/hrc cluster coding for a T3SS, flanking effector loci, and any close orthologue of known P. syringae effectors. Nonetheless, P. syringae group 2c strains are common leaf colonizers and grow on some tested plant species to population densities higher than those obtained by other P. syringae strains on nonhost species. Moreover, group 2c strains have genes necessary for the production of phytotoxins, have an ice nucleation gene, and, most interestingly, contain a novel hrp/hrc cluster, which is only distantly related to the canonical P. syringae hrp/hrc cluster. This hrp/hrc cluster appears to encode a functional T3SS although the genes hrpK and hrpS, present in the classical P. syringae hrp/hrc cluster, are missing. The genome sequence of a representative group 2c strain also revealed distant orthologues of the P. syringae effector genes avrE1 and hopM1 and the P. aeruginosa effector genes exoU and exoY. A putative life cycle for group 2c P. syringae is discussed.	23	2	198-210	10.1094/MPMI-23-2-0198	Clarke;Cai;Studholme;Guttman;Vinatzer	Christopher R;Rongman;David J;David S;Boris A	Department of Plant Pathology, Physiology, and Weed Science, Virginia Tech, Latham Hall, Ag Quad Lane, Blacksburg 24061, USA.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Rickettsia peacockii, also known as the East Side Agent, is a non-pathogenic obligate intracellular bacterium found as an endosymbiont in Dermacentor andersoni ticks in the western USA and Canada. Its presence in ticks is correlated with reduced prevalence of Rickettsia rickettsii, the agent of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. It has been proposed that a virulent SFG rickettsia underwent changes to become the East Side Agent. We determined the genome sequence of R. peacockii and provide a comparison to a closely related virulent R. rickettsii. The presence of 42 chromosomal copies of the ISRpe1 transposon in the genome of R. peacockii is associated with a lack of synteny with the genome of R. rickettsii and numerous deletions via recombination between transposon copies. The plasmid contains a number of genes from distantly related organisms, such as part of the glycosylation island of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Genes deleted or mutated in R. peacockii which may relate to loss of virulence include those coding for an ankyrin repeat containing protein, DsbA, RickA, protease II, OmpA, ScaI, and a putative phosphoethanolamine transferase. The gene coding for the ankyrin repeat containing protein is especially implicated as it is mutated in R. rickettsii strain Iowa, which has attenuated virulence. Presence of numerous copies of the ISRpe1 transposon, likely acquired by lateral transfer from a Cardinium species, are associated with extensive genomic reorganization and deletions. The deletion and mutation of genes possibly involved in loss of virulence have been identified by this genomic comparison. It also illustrates that the introduction of a transposon into the genome can have varied effects; either correlating with an increase in pathogenicity as in Francisella tularensis or a loss of pathogenicity as in R. peacockii and the recombination enabled by multiple transposon copies can cause significant deletions in some genomes while not in others.	4	12	e8361	10.1371/journal.pone.0008361	Felsheim;Kurtti;Munderloh	Roderick F;Timothy J;Ulrike G	Department of Entomology, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA.	eng	Microbes Infect. 1999 Dec;1(14):1221-8;Genome Biol. 2007;8(6):R102;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:364;Infect Immun. 2008 Feb;76(2):542-50;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 Feb;74(3):645-52;J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(7):2488-95;Infect Immun. 2008 Apr;76(4):1498-508;FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 2008 Jun;53(1):26-34;Science. 2008 Jun 20;320(5883):1651-4;Bioinformatics. 2000 Oct;16(10):944-5;Infect Immun. 2008 Dec;76(12):5777-89;Mol Microbiol. 2009 Jan;71(1):227-39;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2009 Mar;75(6):1786-9;J Bacteriol. 2009 Apr;191(7):2083-90;PLoS One. 2009;4(5):e5612;Infect Immun. 2009 Jun;77(6):2385-91;BMC Genomics. 2009;10:166;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2001 Feb;67(2):546-52;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jul 31;98(16):9342-7;Environ Microbiol. 2001 Jul;3(7):440-9;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2001 Oct 16;204(1):81-8;Exp Parasitol. 2001 Oct;99(2):66-72;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Feb 15;30(4):866-75;Infect Immun. 2003 Mar;71(3):1590-5;J Bacteriol. 2003 Jun;185(11):3270-7;J Biol Chem. 2004 Mar 19;279(12):11222-8;Mol Ecol. 2004 Jul;13(7):2009-16;Genome Res. 2004 Jul;14(7):1394-403;Microbiology. 2004 Sep;150(Pt 9):2993-3000;Mol Biol Evol. 2004 Oct;21(10):1981-91;J Mol Biol. 2004 Oct 15;343(2):445-55;Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1981 Jan;30(1):230-8;Infect Immun. 1982 Aug;37(2):779-85;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Jul 1;89(13):6210-4;J Invertebr Pathol. 1996 May;67(3):318-21;Int J Syst Bacteriol. 1997 Apr;47(2):446-52;Microb Pathog. 1998 May;24(5):289-98;Infect Immun. 1998 Aug;66(8):3909-17;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1999 Feb;65(2):773-8;J Clin Microbiol. 1999 Aug;37(8):2518-24;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2004 Nov;70(11):6628-36;Biochem J. 2005 May 15;388(Pt 1):29-38;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2005 Sep;3(9):688-99;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Oct;58(1):71-9;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Oct;71(10):5969-82;J Invertebr Pathol. 2005 Nov;90(3):177-86;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Feb;59(4):1114-28;Gene. 2006 Mar 15;369:119-25;BMC Microbiol. 2006;6:12;Microbes Infect. 2006 Mar;8(3):801-9;Res Microbiol. 2006 Sep;157(7):605-12;PLoS One. 2007;2(3):e266;Cell Microbiol. 2007 May;9(5):1284-96;Trends Genet. 2007 Oct;23(10):511-20;Nature. 2007 Oct 18;449(7164):835-42;Genome Res. 2007 Nov;17(11):1657-64;Res Microbiol. 2007 Dec;158(10):745-53;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2008 Jan;278(2):213-22;J Biol Chem. 2008 Aug 29;283(35):23739-53	MEDLINE	epublish

Bacteriol.	1098-5530	Genome diversity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 laboratory strains.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 is the most commonly used strain for research on this ubiquitous and metabolically versatile opportunistic pathogen. Strain PAO1, a derivative of the original Australian PAO isolate, has been distributed worldwide to laboratories and strain collections. Over decades discordant phenotypes of PAO1 sublines have emerged. Taking the existing PAO1-UW genome sequence (named after the University of Washington, which led the sequencing project) as a blueprint, the genome sequences of reference strains MPAO1 and PAO1-DSM (stored at the German Collection for Microorganisms and Cell Cultures [DSMZ]) were resolved by physical mapping and deep short read sequencing-by-synthesis. MPAO1 has been the source of near-saturation libraries of transposon insertion mutants, and PAO1-DSM is identical in its SpeI-DpnI restriction map with the original isolate. The major genomic differences of MPAO1 and PAO1-DSM in comparison to PAO1-UW are the lack of a large inversion, a duplication of a mobile 12-kb prophage region carrying a distinct integrase and protein phosphatases or kinases, deletions of 3 to 1,006 bp in size, and at least 39 single-nucleotide substitutions, 17 of which affect protein sequences. The PAO1 sublines differed in their ability to cope with nutrient limitation and their virulence in an acute murine airway infection model. Subline PAO1-DSM outnumbered the two other sublines in late stationary growth phase. In conclusion, P. aeruginosa PAO1 shows an ongoing microevolution of genotype and phenotype that jeopardizes the reproducibility of research. High-throughput genome resequencing will resolve more cases and could become a proper quality control for strain collections.	192	4	1113-21	10.1128/JB.01515-09	Klockgether;Munder;Neugebauer;Davenport;Stanke;Larbig;Heeb;Schöck;Pohl;Wiehlmann;Tümmler	Jens;Antje;Jens;Colin F;Frauke;Karen D;Stephan;Ulrike;Thomas M;Lutz;Burkhard	Klinische Forschergruppe, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany. klockgether.jens@mh-hannover.de	eng	Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Apr 14;106(15):6339-44;J Bacteriol. 2001 Sep;183(18):5213-22;Exp Toxicol Pathol. 2002 Aug;54(2):127-33;Hum Genet. 2003 Jan;112(1):1-11;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Nov 25;100(24):14339-44;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2004 May;70(5):2741-7;Microbiol Rev. 1979 Mar;43(1):73-102;EMBO J. 1989 Dec 20;8(13):4081-9;Gene. 1990 May 31;90(1):1-7;Microbiol Rev. 1992 Sep;56(3):395-411;Microbiology. 1994 Nov;140 ( Pt 11):2907-29;J Bacteriol. 1999 Oct;181(20):6300-5;J Gen Microbiol. 1955 Dec;13(3):572-81;Genome Res. 2005 Apr;15(4):583-9;Microbes Infect. 2005 Apr;7(4):600-11;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jul;187(14):4875-83;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006 May;50(5):1623-7;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;Nucleic Acids Res. 2006;34(12):3484-93;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;J Bacteriol. 2007 Jun;189(12):4449-55;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2007;61:589-618;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 Mar;74(6):1902-8;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):821-9;BMC Genomics. 2008;9:167;Microbiology. 2008 Jun;154(Pt 6):1599-604;Genome Res. 2008 Sep;18(9):1538-43;Microbiology. 2008 Oct;154(Pt 10):3175-87;Genomics. 2008 Nov;92(5):255-64;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Dec;36(21):6676-87;Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jan;37(Database issue):D483-8;Genome Res. 2009 Jan;19(1):12-23;J Mol Biol. 2009 Feb 27;386(3):802-13;ISME J. 2009 Mar;3(3):271-82;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2000 Nov 1;192(1):107-12	MEDLINE	ppublish

Microbiol.	1462-2920	Comparative analysis of the widespread and conserved PB1-like viruses infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	We examined the genetic diversity of lytic Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage PB1 and four closely related phages (LBL3, LMA2, 14-1 and SN) isolated throughout Europe. They all encapsulate linear, non-permuted genomes between 64 427 and 66 530 bp within a solid, acid-resistant isometric capsid (diameter: 74 nm) and carry non-flexible, contractile tails of approximately 140 nm. The genomes are organized into at least seven transcriptional blocks, alternating on both strands, and encode between 88 (LBL3) and 95 (LMA2) proteins. Their virion particles are composed of at least 22 different proteins, which were identified using mass spectrometry. Post-translational modifications were suggested for two proteins, and a frameshift hotspot was identified within ORF42, encoding a structural protein. Despite large temporal and spatial separations between phage isolations, very high sequence similarity and limited horizontal gene transfer were found between the individual viruses. These PB1-like viruses constitute a new genus of environmentally very widespread phages within the Myoviridae.	11	11	2874-83	10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02030.x	Ceyssens;Miroshnikov;Mattheus;Krylov;Robben;Noben;Vanderschraeghe;Sykilinda;Kropinski;Volckaert;Mesyanzhinov;Lavigne	Pieter-Jan;Konstantin;Wesley;Victor;Johan;Jean-Paul;Simon;Nina;Andrew M;Guido;Vadim;Rob	Division of Gene Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 21, Leuven, Belgium.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Mycobacterium abscessus is an emerging rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM) causing a pseudotuberculous lung disease to which patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are particularly susceptible. We report here its complete genome sequence. The genome of M. abscessus (CIP 104536T) consists of a 5,067,172-bp circular chromosome including 4920 predicted coding sequences (CDS), an 81-kb full-length prophage and 5 IS elements, and a 23-kb mercury resistance plasmid almost identical to pMM23 from Mycobacterium marinum. The chromosome encodes many virulence proteins and virulence protein families absent or present in only small numbers in the model RGM species Mycobacterium smegmatis. Many of these proteins are encoded by genes belonging to a mycobacterial gene pool (e.g. PE and PPE proteins, MCE and YrbE proteins, lipoprotein LpqH precursors). However, many others (e.g. phospholipase C, MgtC, MsrA, ABC Fe(3+) transporter) appear to have been horizontally acquired from distantly related environmental bacteria with a high G+C content, mostly actinobacteria (e.g. Rhodococcus sp., Streptomyces sp.) and pseudomonads. We also identified several metabolic regions acquired from actinobacteria and pseudomonads (relating to phenazine biosynthesis, homogentisate catabolism, phenylacetic acid degradation, DNA degradation) not present in the M. smegmatis genome. Many of the non mycobacterial factors detected in M. abscessus are also present in two of the pathogens most frequently isolated from CF patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia. This study elucidates the genetic basis of the unique pathogenicity of M. abscessus among RGM, and raises the question of similar mechanisms of pathogenicity shared by unrelated organisms in CF patients.	4	6	e5660	10.1371/journal.pone.0005660	Ripoll;Pasek;Schenowitz;Dossat;Barbe;Rottman;Macheras;Heym;Herrmann;Daffé;Brosch;Risler;Gaillard	Fabienne;Sophie;Chantal;Carole;Valérie;Martin;Edouard;Beate;Jean-Louis;Mamadou;Roland;Jean-Loup;Jean-Louis	EA3647, UFR de médecine Paris Ile-de-France Ouest, Université de Versailles St-Quentin, Garches, France.	eng	FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1998 Nov 1;168(1):77-84;Curr Microbiol. 1999 Apr;38(4):233-8;Mol Microbiol. 1999 May;32(3):643-55;Science. 1999 May 28;284(5419):1520-3;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 3;101(5):1345-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004;32(5):1792-7;Infect Immun. 2004 Jul;72(7):4010-22;Comput Biol Chem. 2004 Jul;28(3):211-8;Am Rev Respir Dis. 1993 May;147(5):1271-8;Microbiol Rev. 1993 Jun;57(2):347-66;Science. 1993 Sep 10;261(5127):1454-7;Crit Rev Microbiol. 1994;20(3):225-41;Infect Immun. 1995 May;63(5):1710-7;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 1996 Aug;154(2 Pt 1):523-8;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1996;50:753-89;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Comput Appl Biosci. 1997 Apr;13(2):137-43;Clin Infect Dis. 1997 Jun;24(6):1147-53;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;J Infect Dis. 1998 Jun;177(6):1573-81;Nature. 1998 Jun 11;393(6685):537-44;Infect Immun. 1998 Aug;66(8):3802-9;J Bacteriol. 2004 Aug;186(15):5062-77;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Oct 12;101(41):14925-30;J Gen Microbiol. 1972 Nov;73(1):55-70;Int J Syst Bacteriol. 1992 Apr;42(2):240-5;Infect Immun. 1999 Sep;67(9):4700-7;Emerg Infect Dis. 1999 Sep-Oct;5(5):681-7;J Invest Dermatol. 1953 Feb;20(2):133-69;Trends Mol Med. 2004 Dec;10(12):599-606;Mol Microbiol. 2000 Mar;35(6):1375-82;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Bioinformatics. 2000 Jun;16(6):560-1;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2000 Dec;64(4):847-67;Bioinformatics. 2000 Oct;16(10):944-5;J Clin Microbiol. 2001 Feb;39(2):816-9;Science. 2001 Feb 23;291(5508):1544-7;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Dec;42(12):5493-501;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Dec;42(12):5582-7;J Clin Microbiol. 2005 Jul;43(7):3467-70;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Sep;57(5):1428-38;Infect Immun. 2005 Sep;73(9):5319-28;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Oct;71(10):6206-15;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2006 Jan;56(Pt 1):133-43;Mol Biol Evol. 2006 Jun;23(6):1129-35;Science. 2006 May 19;312(5776):1044-6;Microbiology. 2006 Jun;152(Pt 6):1581-90;Thorax. 2006 Jun;61(6):507-13;Syst Biol. 2006 Aug;55(4):539-52;Bioinformatics. 2006 Sep 15;22(18):2196-203;Infect Immun. 2006 Oct;74(10):5477-86;BMC Evol Biol. 2006;6:95;Infect Immun. 2007 Feb;75(2):1055-8;Genome Res. 2007 Feb;17(2):192-200;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2007 Feb 15;175(4):367-416;J Clin Microbiol. 2007 May;45(5):1497-504;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007;35(9):3100-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jun 26;104(26):11038-43;Mol Biol Evol. 2007 Aug;24(8):1861-71;J Clin Microbiol. 2007 Sep;45(9):3127-30;Infect Immun. 2007 Dec;75(12):5898-907;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;J Clin Microbiol. 2008 Mar;46(3):850-5;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):729-41;Trends Microbiol. 2008 Jul;16(7):303-8;Biodegradation. 2008 Nov;19(6):859-81;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Apr;53(4):1367-76;Nature. 2001 Feb 22;409(6823):1007-11;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Mar;39(6):1434-42;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Aug 14;98(17):9901-6;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2002 Apr;15(2):194-222;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Jul;45(1):203-17;Infect Immun. 2002 Oct;70(10):5568-78;Clin Microbiol Rev. 2002 Oct;15(4):716-46;Microbiology. 2002 Oct;148(Pt 10):2987-96;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2002 Nov;68(11):5318-25;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Mar 4;100(5):2771-6;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2003 Mar 15;167(6):828-34;Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2003 Mar 15;167(6):810-2;Cell. 2003 Apr 18;113(2):171-82;Comput Biol Chem. 2003 Feb;27(1):59-67;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2003 Jun;27(2-3):355-84;Syst Biol. 2003 Oct;52(5):696-704;Environ Microbiol. 2003 Dec;5(12):1341-9;J Mol Evol. 2003 Oct;57(4):479-86;Emerg Infect Dis. 2003 Dec;9(12):1587-91	MEDLINE	epublish

Giant bacteriophages phiKZ and EL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa contain 62 and 64 structural proteins, respectively, identified by ESI-MS/MS on total virion particle proteins. These identifications verify gene predictions and delineate the genomic regions dedicated to phage assembly and capsid formation (30 proteins were identified from a tailless phiKZ mutant). These data form the basis for future structural studies and provide insights into the relatedness of these large phages. The phiKZ structural proteome strongly correlates to that of Pseudomonas chlororaphis bacteriophage 201phi2-1. Phage EL is more distantly related, shown by its 26 non-conserved structural proteins and the presence of genomic inversions.	9	11	3215-9	10.1002/pmic.200800727	Lecoutere;Ceyssens;Miroshnikov;Mesyanzhinov;Krylov;Noben;Robben;Hertveldt;Volckaert;Lavigne	Elke;Pieter-Jan;Konstantin A;Vadim V;Victor N;Jean-Paul;Johan;Kirsten;Guido;Rob	Division of Gene Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates have a highly conserved core genome representing up to 90% of the total genomic sequence with additional variable accessory genes, many of which are found in genomic islands or islets. The identification of the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES) in a children's cystic fibrosis (CF) unit in 1996 and its subsequent observation in several centers in the United Kingdom challenged the previous widespread assumption that CF patients acquire only unique strains of P. aeruginosa from the environment. To learn about the forces that shaped the development of this important epidemic strain, the genome of the earliest archived LES isolate, LESB58, was sequenced. The sequence revealed the presence of many large genomic islands, including five prophage clusters, one defective (pyocin) prophage cluster, and five non-phage islands. To determine the role of these clusters, an unbiased signature tagged mutagenesis study was performed, followed by selection in the chronic rat lung infection model. Forty-seven mutants were identified by sequencing, including mutants in several genes known to be involved in Pseudomonas infection. Furthermore, genes from four prophage clusters and one genomic island were identified and in direct competition studies with the parent isolate; four were demonstrated to strongly impact on competitiveness in the chronic rat lung infection model. This strongly indicates that enhanced in vivo competitiveness is a major driver for maintenance and diversifying selection of these genomic prophage genes.	19	1	12-23	10.1101/gr.086082.108	Winstanley;Langille;Fothergill;Kukavica-Ibrulj;Paradis-Bleau;Sanschagrin;Thomson;Winsor;Quail;Lennard;Bignell;Clarke;Seeger;Saunders;Harris;Parkhill;Hancock;Brinkman;Levesque	Craig;Morgan G I;Joanne L;Irena;Catherine;François;Nicholas R;Geoff L;Michael A;Nicola;Alexandra;Louise;Kathy;David;David;Julian;Robert E W;Fiona S L;Roger C	Division of Medical Microbiology and Genitourinary Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, United Kingdom.	eng	J Bacteriol. 1999 Apr;181(7):2166-74;Cell Microbiol. 2006 Nov;8(11):1707-19;Microbiology. 2007 Jun;153(Pt 6):1790-8;J Bacteriol. 1990 Nov;172(11):6568-72;Genome Biol. 2006;7(4):R34;Lancet. 1996 Sep 7;348(9028):639-42;J Bacteriol. 2001 Feb;183(3):843-53;Drug Resist Updat. 2000 Aug;3(4):247-255;BMC Bioinformatics. 2008;9:329;Thorax. 2008 Sep;63(9):839-40;Microb Drug Resist. 2006 Fall;12(3):164-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 8;104(19):8101-6;J Cyst Fibros. 2008 May;7(3):258-61;J Bacteriol. 2004 Dec;186(23):8066-73;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jul 31;98(16):9342-7;J Hosp Infect. 2005 Feb;59(2):102-7;J Med Microbiol. 2006 Aug;55(Pt 8):1085-91;Microbiology. 2004 May;150(Pt 5):1315-26;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jan 1;33(Database issue):D338-43;J Clin Microbiol. 2000 Feb;38(2):883-5;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Annu Rev Phytopathol. 1999;37:175-196;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):400-10;Mol Microbiol. 2006 Aug;61(3):555-9;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):898-911;Infect Immun. 2006 Sep;74(9):5272-83;Thorax. 2002 Jun;57(6):559-60;Mol Microbiol. 2000 Oct;38(2):213-31;J Immunol. 2008 Jun 1;180(11):7764-73;J Med Microbiol. 2006 Jun;55(Pt 6):677-88;Environ Microbiol. 2003 Dec;5(12):1341-9;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3100-5;Lancet. 2001 Aug 18;358(9281):558-60;Bioinformatics. 2007 Mar 15;23(6):673-9;Infect Immun. 1983 Oct;42(1):170-7;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Aug;49(8):3222-7;Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2005 Jul;33(1):56-64;Mol Microbiol. 1998 Sep;29(6):1419-34;PLoS Genet. 2005 Nov;1(5):e62;J Bacteriol. 2003 Feb;185(4):1316-25;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jan 1;30(1):281-3;J Bacteriol. 2004 Nov;186(21):7312-26;J Bacteriol. 2005 Mar;187(6):2138-47;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jul;187(14):4908-20;Proc Biol Sci. 2005 Jul 7;272(1570):1385-91;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):518-34;J Bacteriol. 2002 Jul;184(13):3614-22;J Med Microbiol. 2004 Jul;53(Pt 7):609-15;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2007 Oct;275(2):244-9;J Clin Microbiol. 2002 Dec;40(12):4607-11;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 8;100(14):8484-9;BMC Bioinformatics. 2006;7:270;Eur Respir J. 2004 Jul;24(1):101-6;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(3):1184-7;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Sep 27;102(39):13950-5;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 24;101(8):2530-5;J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(8):2739-58;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1983 Apr;80(7):2059-62;J Bacteriol. 2003 Aug;185(15):4585-92;Infect Immun. 1988 Mar;56(3):665-72;J Clin Microbiol. 2003 May;41(5):2266-7;Methods Mol Biol. 2008;416:61-82;J Clin Microbiol. 2004 Dec;42(12):5783-92;BMC Microbiol. 2007;7:45;Bioinformatics. 2005 Mar 1;21(5):617-23;J Bacteriol. 2000 Nov;182(21):6066-74;J Bacteriol. 2002 Dec;184(23):6665-80;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Dec 26;103(52):19830-5;J Cyst Fibros. 2004 Mar;3(1):37-44;Genome Res. 2004 Jul;14(7):1394-403;Bioinformatics. 2006 Sep 15;22(18):2196-203;Thorax. 2004 Apr;59(4):334-6;Am Rev Respir Dis. 1979 Mar;119(3):453-9;Genetika. 1984 Oct;20(10):1612-9;J Bacteriol. 2008 Apr;190(8):2804-13;J Mol Biol. 1991 Mar 20;218(2):349-64	MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage (phage) is one of the most taxonomically and genetically diverse phages. Although phage D3 is one of well-studied P. aeruginosa phages, no D3-related P. aeruginosa phage has been reported. We report a novel P. aeruginosa siphovirus, PAJU2, which is genetically related to but morphology distinct (highly elongated head) from phage D3. A PAJU2 capsid protein, Orf3, is thought to be synthesized as a protein fused to a prohead protease and is autocatalytically cleaved, which may form the head chain mail. Despite such morphological differences, PAJU2 is expected to be a useful genetic reference for phage D3.	139	1	131-4	10.1016/j.virusres.2008.10.005	Uchiyama;Rashel;Matsumoto;Sumiyama;Wakiguchi;Matsuzaki	Jumpei;Mohammad;Tetsuya;Yoshinobu;Hiroshi;Shigenobu	Department of Pediatrics, Kochi Medical School, Kochi, Japan.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a well-studied opportunistic pathogen that is particularly known for its intrinsic antimicrobial resistance, diverse metabolic capacity, and its ability to cause life threatening infections in cystic fibrosis patients. The Pseudomonas Genome Database (http://www.pseudomonas.com) was originally developed as a resource for peer-reviewed, continually updated annotation for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 reference strain genome. In order to facilitate cross-strain and cross-species genome comparisons with other Pseudomonas species of importance, we have now expanded the database capabilities to include all Pseudomonas species, and have developed or incorporated methods to facilitate high quality comparative genomics. The database contains robust assessment of orthologs, a novel ortholog clustering method, and incorporates five views of the data at the sequence and annotation levels (Gbrowse, Mauve and custom views) to facilitate genome comparisons. A choice of simple and more flexible user-friendly Boolean search features allows researchers to search and compare annotations or sequences within or between genomes. Other features include more accurate protein subcellular localization predictions and a user-friendly, Boolean searchable log file of updates for the reference strain PAO1. This database aims to continue to provide a high quality, annotated genome resource for the research community and is available under an open source license.	37	Database issue	D483-8	10.1093/nar/gkn861	Winsor;Van Rossum;Lo;Khaira;Whiteside;Hancock;Brinkman	Geoffrey L;Thea;Raymond;Bhavjinder;Matthew D;Robert E W;Fiona S L	Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.	eng	Genome Res. 2005 Apr;15(4):583-9;Bioinformatics. 2005 Apr 1;21(7):880-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 Jan 1;34(Database issue):D344-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8;BMC Bioinformatics. 2006;7:270;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2006 Oct;4(10):741-51;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Oct 17;103(42):15582-7;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Jan;35(Database issue):D5-12;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Jan;35(Database issue):D533-7;Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jan;36(Database issue):D519-23;BMC Bioinformatics. 2008;9:329;Mol Syst Biol. 2008;4:218;Nucleic Acids Res. 2000 Jan 1;28(1):33-6;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):933;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Bioinformatics. 2002;18 Suppl 1:S225-32;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jan 1;30(1):276-80;Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Jan 1;29(1):123-5;Genome Res. 2002 Oct;12(10):1599-610;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jul 1;31(13):3497-500;BMC Bioinformatics. 2003 Sep 11;4:41;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Nov 25;100(24):14339-44;Genome Res. 2004 Jul;14(7):1394-403;J Bacteriol. 1999 Aug;181(16):4746-54;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jan 1;33(Database issue):D164-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jan 1;33(Database issue):D338-43;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jan 1;33(Database issue):D39-45;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jan 1;33(Database issue):D418-24;Genome Res. 2005 Feb;15(2):321-9;Bioinformatics. 2005 Mar 1;21(5):617-23;Genome Res. 2005 Jul;15(7):1015-22	MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriol.	1098-5530	Interaction between bacteriophage DMS3 and host CRISPR region inhibits group behaviors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	Bacteriophage infection has profound effects on bacterial biology. Clustered regular interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and cas (CRISPR-associated) genes are found in most archaea and many bacteria and have been reported to play a role in resistance to bacteriophage infection. We observed that lysogenic infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 with bacteriophage DMS3 inhibits biofilm formation and swarming motility, both important bacterial group behaviors. This inhibition requires the CRISPR region in the host. Mutation or deletion of five of the six cas genes and one of the two CRISPRs in this region restored biofilm formation and swarming to DMS3 lysogenized strains. Our observations suggest a role for CRISPR regions in modifying the effects of lysogeny on P. aeruginosa.	191	1	210-9	10.1128/JB.00797-08	Zegans;Wagner;Cady;Murphy;Hammond;O'Toole	Michael E;Jeffrey C;Kyle C;Daniel M;John H;George A	Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.	eng	J Bacteriol. 2008 Feb;190(4):1390-400;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Jan;55(2):469-81;J Bacteriol. 2002 Oct;184(20):5733-45;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2008 Mar;6(3):181-6;Microbiology. 2007 Sep;153(Pt 9):2885-95;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1997 Nov;63(11):4543-51;J Mol Biol. 2002 Mar 29;317(3):337-59;Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol. 2002 Dec;133(4):463-76;Methods Enzymol. 1999;310:91-109;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Mar;39(5):1237-47;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):400-10;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jan;187(2):771-7;Biol Direct. 2006 Mar 16;1:7;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Science. 1995 Jun 30;268(5219):1899-902;J Bacteriol. 2005 Feb;187(4):1441-54;Annu Rev Genet. 1986;20:385-429;J Bacteriol. 2000 Nov;182(21):5990-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Dec 15;25(24):4876-82;Curr Microbiol. 1999 Apr;38(4):239-43;Nucleic Acids Res. 1986 Jun 25;14(12):4881-97;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2000 Mar;64(1):69-114;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Jan;55(2):368-80;J Bacteriol. 2004 May;186(10):3270-3;J Comput Biol. 2002;9(5):707-20;Science. 2007 Mar 23;315(5819):1709-12;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;J Bacteriol. 2004 Oct;186(19):6560-74;Pharmacol Ther. 1999 Dec;84(3):367-88;Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Jul;35(Web Server issue):W52-7;BMC Bioinformatics. 2007;8:172;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Jul;71(7):4044-51;Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Feb 15;26(4):1107-15;Science. 2008 Aug 15;321(5891):960-4;Bioinformatics. 2000 Oct;16(10):944-5;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Jul;57(2):347-56;J Bacteriol. 2007 Nov;189(22):8165-78;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2003;57:249-73;Comput Appl Biosci. 1996 Aug;12(4):357-8;Microbiology. 2005 Mar;151(Pt 3):653-63;Biochemistry. 1986 Jun 3;25(11):3209-13;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jul 1;32(Web Server issue):W327-31;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2004 Sep;68(3):560-602, table of contents;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2006 Jul;72(7):5027-36;Cell. 2005 Dec 2;123(5):861-73;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 May 28;99(11):7536-41;Nucleic Acids Res. 1993 Aug 25;21(17):4019-23;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2004 May;28(2):127-81;PLoS Comput Biol. 2005 Nov;1(6):e60;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8	MEDLINE	ppublish

Biol.	1553-7358	Gene-boosted assembly of a novel bacterial genome from very short reads.	Recent improvements in technology have made DNA sequencing dramatically faster and more efficient than ever before. The new technologies produce highly accurate sequences, but one drawback is that the most efficient technology produces the shortest read lengths. Short-read sequencing has been applied successfully to resequence the human genome and those of other species but not to whole-genome sequencing of novel organisms. Here we describe the sequencing and assembly of a novel clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strain PAb1, using very short read technology. From 8,627,900 reads, each 33 nucleotides in length, we assembled the genome into one scaffold of 76 ordered contiguous sequences containing 6,290,005 nucleotides, including one contig spanning 512,638 nucleotides, plus an additional 436 unordered contigs containing 416,897 nucleotides. Our method includes a novel gene-boosting algorithm that uses amino acid sequences from predicted proteins to build a better assembly. This study demonstrates the feasibility of very short read sequencing for the sequencing of bacterial genomes, particularly those for which a related species has been sequenced previously, and expands the potential application of this new technology to most known prokaryotic species.	4	9	e1000186	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000186	Salzberg;Sommer;Puiu;Lee	Steven L;Daniel D;Daniela;Vincent T	Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, United States of America. salzberg@umd.edu	eng	Science. 2000 Mar 24;287(5461):2196-204;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):810-20;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Genome Res. 2002 Jan;12(1):177-89;Nature. 2002 Apr 18;416(6882):740-3;Genome Res. 2003 Jan;13(1):91-6;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Nov;50(3):809-24;Genome Biol. 2004;5(2):R12;Brief Bioinform. 2004 Sep;5(3):237-48;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Am J Infect Control. 2004 Dec;32(8):470-85;Nature. 2005 Aug 25;436(7054):1171-5;Nature. 2005 Sep 15;437(7057):376-80;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005;33(19):e171;Genome Res. 2005 Dec;15(12):1767-76;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):821-9;Science. 2006 Feb 24;311(5764):1113-6;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2006 Apr;9(2):218-28;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2839-44;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jul 25;103(30):11240-5;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;Bioinformatics. 2007 Feb 15;23(4):500-1;Genes Dev. 2007 Mar 1;21(5):601-14;BMC Bioinformatics. 2007;8:64;Bioinformatics. 2007 Mar 15;23(6):673-9;Nat Methods. 2007 Aug;4(8):651-7;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Aug;65(4):876-95;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Sep;65(6):1474-84;Nat Methods. 2008 Feb;5(2):183-8;Genome Res. 2008 Feb;18(2):324-30;Trends Genet. 2008 Mar;24(3):133-41;Genome Res. 2008 May;18(5):802-9;Trends Genet. 2000 Jun;16(6):276-7	MEDLINE	epublish

Overproduction of the exopolysaccharide alginate and conversion to a mucoid phenotype in Pseudomonas aeruginosa are markers for the onset of chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF). Alginate production is regulated by the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor AlgU/T and the cognate anti-sigma factor MucA. Many clinical mucoid isolates carry loss-of-function mutations in mucA. These mutations, including the most common mucA22 allele, cause C-terminal truncations in MucA, indicating that an inability to regulate AlgU activity by MucA is associated with conversion to the mucoid phenotype. Here we report that a mutation in a stable mucoid strain derived from the parental strain PAO1, designated PAO581, that does not contain the mucA22 allele, was due to a single-base deletion in mucA (DeltaT180), generating another type of C-terminal truncation. A global mariner transposon screen in PAO581 for non-mucoid isolates led to the identification of three regulators of alginate production, clpP (PA1801), clpX (PA1802), and a clpP paralogue (PA3326, designated clpP2). The PAO581 null mutants of clpP, clpX and clpP2 showed decreased AlgU transcriptional activity and an accumulation of haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged N-terminal MucA protein with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa. The clpP and clpX mutants of a CF mucoid isolate revert to the non-mucoid phenotype. The ClpXP and ClpP2 proteins appear to be part of a proteolytic network that degrades the cytoplasmic portion of truncated MucA proteins to release the sequestered AlgU, which drives alginate biosynthesis.	154	Pt 7	2119-30	10.1099/mic.0.2008/017368-0	Qiu;Eisinger;Head;Pier;Yu	Dongru;Vonya M;Nathan E;Gerald B;Hongwei D	Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Joan C.

Pseudomonas chlororaphis phage 201varphi2-1 is a relative of Pseudomonas aeruginosa myovirus phiKZ. Phage 201 phi2-1 was examined by complete genomic sequencing (316,674 bp), by a comprehensive mass spectrometry survey of its virion proteins and by electron microscopy. Seventy-six proteins, of which at least 69 have homologues in phiKZ, were identified by mass spectrometry. Eight proteins, in addition to the major head, tail sheath and tail tube proteins, are abundant in the virion. Electron microscopy of 201 phi2-1 revealed a multitude of long, fine fibers apparently decorating the tail sheath protein. Among the less abundant virion proteins are three homologues to RNA polymerase beta or beta' subunits. Comparison between the genomes of 201 phi2-1 and phiKZ revealed substantial conservation of the genome plan, and a large region with an especially high rate of gene replacement. The phiKZ-like phages exhibited a two-fold higher rate of divergence than for T4-like phages or host genomes.	376	2	330-8	10.1016/j.virol.2008.04.004	Thomas;Rolando;Carroll;Shen;Belnap;Weintraub;Serwer;Hardies	Julie A;Mandy R;Christopher A;Peter S;David M;Susan T;Philip;Stephen C	Department of Biochemistry, The University of Texas Health Science Center, 7703 Floyd Curl Drive, San Antonio, Texas 78229-3900, USA.	eng	Nature. 1974 Nov 1;252(5478):21-4;J Virol. 1977 Oct;24(1):194-200;J Ultrastruct Res. 1967 Feb;17(3):342-7;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2003 Mar;67(1):86-156, table of contents;Nature. 2002 Oct 3;419(6906):537-42;J Mol Biol. 2002 Mar 15;317(1):1-19;Virology. 2007 Nov 25;368(2):405-21;Can J Microbiol. 1984 Jun;30(6):758-62;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Mar;84(5):1192-6;J Bacteriol. 1989 Apr;171(4):1967-73;Mol Biol Evol. 1993 May;10(3):512-26;Science. 1996 Jul 5;273(5271):107-9;Comput Appl Biosci. 1996 Apr;12(2):95-107;Comput Appl Biosci. 1997 Oct;13(5):555-6;Bioinformatics. 1998;14(10):846-56;Cell. 1999 Sep 17;98(6):811-24;Virology. 2004 Nov 24;329(2):412-24;BMC Evol Biol. 2004 Nov 9;4:44;Bioinformatics. 2005 Apr 1;21(7):951-60;Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W244-8;J Mol Biol. 2005 Sep 9;352(1):117-24;Anal Chem. 2005 Oct 1;77(19):6218-24;J Mol Biol. 2005 Dec 2;354(3):536-45;Microbiology. 2006 Feb;152(Pt 2):529-34;Biochemistry (Mosc). 2006 Mar;71(3):300-5;Mol Biol Evol. 2006 Sep;23(9):1688-96;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2007 Jan;266(2):201-9;Virology. 2007 Jun 5;362(2):384-96;Electrophoresis. 2007 Jun;28(12):1896-902;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Sep;65(5):1334-44;Structure. 2007 Sep;15(9):1099-104;Arch Virol. 2007;152(10):1955-9	MEDLINE	ppublish

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	1091-6490	Dynamics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa genome evolution.	One of the hallmarks of the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is its ability to thrive in diverse environments that includes humans with a variety of debilitating diseases or immune deficiencies. Here we report the complete sequence and comparative analysis of the genomes of two representative P. aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients whose genetic disorder predisposes them to infections by this pathogen. The comparison of the genomes of the two CF strains with those of other P. aeruginosa presents a picture of a mosaic genome, consisting of a conserved core component, interrupted in each strain by combinations of specific blocks of genes. These strain-specific segments of the genome are found in limited chromosomal locations, referred to as regions of genomic plasticity. The ability of P. aeruginosa to shape its genomic composition to favor survival in the widest range of environmental reservoirs, with corresponding enhancement of its metabolic capacity is supported by the identification of a genomic island in one of the sequenced CF isolates, encoding enzymes capable of degrading terpenoids produced by trees. This work suggests that niche adaptation is a major evolutionary force influencing the composition of bacterial genomes. Unlike genome reduction seen in host-adapted bacterial pathogens, the genetic capacity of P. aeruginosa is determined by the ability of individual strains to acquire or discard genomic segments, giving rise to strains with customized genomic repertoires. Consequently, this organism can survive in a wide range of environmental reservoirs that can serve as sources of the infecting organisms.	105	8	3100-5	10.1073/pnas.0711982105	Mathee;Narasimhan;Valdes;Qiu;Matewish;Koehrsen;Rokas;Yandava;Engels;Zeng;Olavarietta;Doud;Smith;Montgomery;White;Godfrey;Kodira;Birren;Galagan;Lory	Kalai;Giri;Camilo;Xiaoyun;Jody M;Michael;Antonis;Chandri N;Reinhard;Erliang;Raquel;Melissa;Roger S;Philip;Jared R;Paul A;Chinnappa;Bruce;James E;Stephen	Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, School of Computing and Information Sciences, College of Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL 33199, USA.	eng	Clin Microbiol Rev. 2002 Apr;15(2):194-222;Cell. 2002 Mar 8;108(5):583-6;J Bacteriol. 2002 Dec;184(23):6665-80;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 8;100(14):8484-9;Nat Genet. 2003 Aug;34(4):377-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Nov 15;31(22):6570-7;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Nov 25;100(24):14339-44;J Infect Dis. 1983 Mar;147(3):494-503;J Bacteriol. 1996 Jan;178(1):85-93;J Mol Biol. 1997 Aug 22;271(3):386-404;Clin Infect Dis. 1997 Aug;25(2):247-59;J Gen Microbiol. 1955 Dec;13(3):572-81;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8;J Bacteriol. 2006 Jun;188(11):4037-50;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Oct 17;103(42):15280-7;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Dec 26;103(52):19830-5;Curr Opin Crit Care. 2007 Feb;13(1):45-50;Genome Biol. 2006;7(10):R90;Mol Microbiol. 2007 Apr;64(1):42-56;J Bacteriol. 2007 Sep;189(17):6195-204;J Bacteriol. 2000 Jul;182(13):3784-93;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Lancet. 2001 Aug 18;358(9281):557-8;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2002;56:539-65	MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriol.	1098-5530	The genome and structural proteome of YuA, a new Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage resembling M6.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage YuA (Siphoviridae) was isolated from a pond near Moscow, Russia. It has an elongated head, encapsulating a circularly permuted genome of 58,663 bp, and a flexible, noncontractile tail, which is terminally and subterminally decorated with short fibers. The YuA genome is neither Mu- nor lambda-like and encodes 78 gene products that cluster in three major regions involved in (i) DNA metabolism and replication, (ii) host interaction, and (iii) phage particle formation and host lysis. At the protein level, YuA displays significant homology with phages M6, phiJL001, 73, B3, DMS3, and D3112. Eighteen YuA proteins were identified as part of the phage particle by mass spectrometry analysis. Five different bacterial promoters were experimentally identified using a promoter trap assay, three of which have a sigma54-specific binding site and regulate transcription in the genome region involved in phage particle formation and host lysis. The dependency of these promoters on the host sigma54 factor was confirmed by analysis of an rpoN mutant strain of P. aeruginosa PAO1. At the DNA level, YuA is 91% identical to the recently (July 2007) annotated phage M6 of the Lindberg typing set. Despite this level of DNA homology throughout the genome, both phages combined have 15 unique genes that do not occur in the other phage. The genome organization of both phages differs substantially from those of the other known Pseudomonas-infecting Siphoviridae, delineating them as a distinct genus within this family.	190	4	1429-35		Ceyssens;Mesyanzhinov;Sykilinda;Briers;Roucourt;Lavigne;Robben;Domashin;Miroshnikov;Volckaert;Hertveldt	Pieter-Jan;Vadim;Nina;Yves;Bart;Rob;Johan;Artem;Konstantin;Guido;Kirsten	Division of Gene Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 21, Leuven B-3001, Belgium.	eng	Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Nov 15;27(22):4305-13;J Bacteriol. 2008 Jan;190(1):457-61;Eur J Biochem. 2000 Feb;267(3):794-9;Trends Microbiol. 2000 Mar;8(3):120-8;J Bacteriol. 2000 Oct;182(20):5823-31;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2000;54:799-825;J Bacteriol. 2000 Nov;182(21):6066-74;Bioinformatics. 2001 Jul;17(7):646-53;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2001;55:283-303;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2001 Sep 11;203(1):11-21;Comput Chem. 2001 Dec;26(1):51-6;Biotechniques. 2001 Dec;31(6):1258, 1260, 1262;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Oct 29;99(22):14250-5;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):898-911;Cell. 2003 Apr 18;113(2):141;Cell. 2003 Apr 18;113(2):171-82;Bioinformatics. 2003 Oct 12;19(15):1964-71;J Bacteriol. 2003 Nov;185(21):6434-47;J Mol Biol. 2004 Jan 16;335(3):667-78;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):400-10;J Bacteriol. 2004 May;186(10):3270-3;J Bacteriol. 2004 Oct;186(19):6560-74;J Gen Virol. 1974 Jul;24(1):1-15;J Infect Dis. 1974 Nov;130 Suppl(0):S33-42;Biochim Biophys Acta. 1975 Jun 16;395(2):109-19;Cell. 1981 Sep;25(3):753-63;Ann Inst Pasteur Virol. 1988 Oct-Dec;139(4):389-404;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;Virology. 1992 Aug;189(2):640-6;J Bacteriol. 1993 Aug;175(15):4843-50;J Bacteriol. 1993 Oct;175(19):6067-74;Protein Expr Purif. 1995 Aug;6(4):423-30;Biochem Soc Trans. 1996 Aug;24(3):893-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Feb 15;26(4):1107-15;Bioinformatics. 1998;14(1):48-54;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Jan 1;27(1):293-4;EMBO J. 1999 Mar 1;18(5):1104-13;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Mar;71(3):1598-609;J Bacteriol. 2005 Jun;187(12):3960-8;Trends Microbiol. 2005 Jun;13(6):278-84;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2005 Aug;8(4):451-8;J Bacteriol. 2006 Feb;188(3):1184-7;Microbiology. 2006 Feb;152(Pt 2):529-34;J Mol Biol. 2006 Dec 8;364(4):667-77;PLoS Biol. 2006 Nov;4(11):e368;Res Microbiol. 2007 Sep;158(7):555-66;Mol Gen Genet. 1999 Dec;262(4-5):659-67	MEDLINE	ppublish

A temperate transposable bacteriophage (MP22) was isolated from a Korean clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It has a coliphage lambda-like morphology and a double-stranded DNA genome. The complete nucleotide sequence and annotation of the MP22 genome and its characteristics are presented. The MP22 genome is 36 409 bp long with a G+C content of 64.2 mol%. The genome contains 51 proposed ORFs, of which 48 (94 %) display synteny and significant nucleotide and protein sequence similarity to the corresponding ORFs of the closely related phage, D3112. Three of the predicted ORFs are unique proteins, whose functions are yet to be revealed. The phage c repressors exhibit striking dissimilarities and, when present as a single gene, did not show cross-immunity. In contrast, although an MP22 lysogen could be productively infected with D3112, MP22 could not grow on a D3112 lysogen, indicating a role of other D3112 genes in superinfection exclusion.	153	Pt 9	2885-95		Heo;Chung;Choi;Lau;Cho	Yun-Jeong;In-Young;Kelly B;Gee W;You-Hee	Department of Life Science, Sogang University, Seoul 121-742, Korea.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Microbiol.	0950-382X	Muralytic activity and modular structure of the endolysins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophages phiKZ and EL.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage endolysins KZ144 (phage phiKZ) and EL188 (phage EL) are highly lytic peptidoglycan hydrolases (210 000 and 390 000 units mg(-1)), active on a broad range of outer membrane-permeabilized Gram-negative species. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates E115 (KZ144) and E155 (EL188) as their respective essential catalytic residues. Remarkably, both endolysins have a modular structure consisting of an N-terminal substrate-binding domain and a predicted C-terminal catalytic module, a property previously only demonstrated in endolysins originating from phages infecting Gram-positives and only in an inverse arrangement. Both binding domains contain conserved repeat sequences, consistent with those of some peptidoglycan hydrolases of Gram-positive bacteria. Fusions of these domains with green fluorescent protein immediately label all outer membrane-permeabilized Gram-negative bacteria tested, isolated P. aeruginosa peptidoglycan and N-acetylated Bacillus subtilis peptidoglycan, demonstrating the broad range of peptidoglycan-binding capacity by these domains. Specifically, A1 chemotype peptidoglycan and fully N-acetylated glucosamine units are essential for binding. Both KZ144 and EL188 appear to be a natural chimeric enzyme, originating from a recombination of a cell wall-binding domain encoded by a Bacillus or Clostridium species and a catalytic domain of an unknown ancestor.	65	5	1334-44		Briers;Volckaert;Cornelissen;Lagaert;Michiels;Hertveldt;Lavigne	Yves;Guido;Anneleen;Stijn;Chris W;Kirsten;Rob	Division of Gene Technology, Department of Biosystems, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 21, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium. yves.briers@biw.kuleuven.be	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Genome biology	Genome Biol.	1474-760X	Genomic analysis reveals that Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence is combinatorial.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium and an important opportunistic human pathogen. Generally, the acquisition of genes in the form of pathogenicity islands distinguishes pathogenic isolates from nonpathogens. We therefore sequenced a highly virulent strain of P. aeruginosa, PA14, and compared it with a previously sequenced (and less pathogenic) strain, PAO1, to identify novel virulence genes.;The PA14 and PAO1 genomes are remarkably similar, although PA14 has a slightly larger genome (6.5 megabses [Mb]) than does PAO1 (6.3 Mb). We identified 58 PA14 gene clusters that are absent in PAO1 to determine which of these genes, if any, contribute to its enhanced virulence in a Caenorhabditis elegans pathogenicity model. First, we tested 18 additional diverse strains in the C. elegans model and observed a wide range of pathogenic potential; however, genotyping these strains using a custom microarray showed that the presence of PA14 genes that are absent in PAO1 did not correlate with the virulence of these strains. Second, we utilized a full-genome nonredundant mutant library of PA14 to identify five genes (absent in PAO1) required for C. elegans killing. Surprisingly, although these five genes are present in many other P. aeruginosa strains, they do not correlate with virulence in C. elegans.;Genes required for pathogenicity in one strain of P. aeruginosa are neither required for nor predictive of virulence in other strains. We therefore propose that virulence in this organism is both multifactorial and combinatorial, the result of a pool of pathogenicity-related genes that interact in various combinations in different genetic backgrounds.	7	10	R90		Lee;Urbach;Wu;Liberati;Feinbaum;Miyata;Diggins;He;Saucier;Déziel;Friedman;Li;Grills;Montgomery;Kucherlapati;Rahme;Ausubel	Daniel G;Jonathan M;Gang;Nicole T;Rhonda L;Sachiko;Lenard T;Jianxin;Maude;Eric;Lisa;Li;George;Kate;Raju;Laurence G;Frederick M	Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.	eng	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Mar 5;99(5):3159-64;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Dec 18;98(26):14760-2;Genome Biol. 2002 Oct 29;3(11):RESEARCH0065;J Bacteriol. 2003 Feb;185(4):1316-25;Infect Immun. 2003 May;71(5):2404-13;Bioinformatics. 2003 May 1;19(7):796-802;Microbes Infect. 2003 Jun;5(7):667-75;Infect Immun. 2003 Jul;71(7):4059-66;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jul 8;100(14):8484-9;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2003 Aug;6(4):332-7;Environ Microbiol. 2003 Dec;5(12):1341-9;Genome Biol. 2004;5(2):R12;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 24;101(8):2530-5;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Apr 27;101(17):6593-8;Mol Microbiol. 2004 Sep;53(5):1279-90;Hosp Pract. 1976 Aug;11(8):91-100;Science. 1995 Jun 30;268(5219):1899-902;Mol Microbiol. 1997 Mar;23(6):1089-97;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Nov 25;94(24):13245-50;Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Jan 15;26(2):544-8;Genome Res. 1998 Mar;8(3):195-202;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Jan 19;96(2):715-20;Cell. 1999 Jan 8;96(1):47-56;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Mar 2;96(5):2408-13;Bioinformatics. 2004 Nov 22;20(17):3246-8;APMIS. 2004 Nov-Dec;112(11-12):930-6;Environ Microbiol. 2005 Jul;7(7):1029-38;Nature. 2005 Nov 10;438(7065):179-84;Science. 2006 Mar 24;311(5768):1730-3;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Dec 1;27(23):4636-41;J Bacteriol. 2002 Feb;184(4):952-61;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2833-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 May 30;103(22):8487-92;Annu Rev Genet. 2004;38:771-92;J Bacteriol. 2000 Jul;182(13):3843-5;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Genome Res. 2001 Apr;11(4):614-25;Microb Comp Genomics. 2000;5(4):189-203;Science. 2002 Jul 26;297(5581):623-6	MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriol.	0021-9193	Genomic analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages LKD16 and LKA1: establishment of the phiKMV subgroup within the T7 supergroup.	Lytic Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages LKD16 and LKA1 were locally isolated and morphologically classified as Podoviridae. While LKD16 adsorbs weakly to its host, LKA1 shows efficient adsorption (ka = 3.9 x 10(-9) ml min(-1)). LKA1, however, displays a narrow host range on clinical P. aeruginosa strains compared to LKD16. Genome analysis of LKD16 (43,200 bp) and LKA1 (41,593 bp) revealed that both phages have linear double-stranded DNA genomes with direct terminal repeats of 428 and 298 bp and encode 54 and 56 genes, respectively. The majority of the predicted structural proteins were experimentally confirmed as part of the phage particle using mass spectrometry. Phage LKD16 is closely related to bacteriophage phiKMV (83% overall DNA homology), allowing a more thoughtful gene annotation of both genomes. In contrast, LKA1 is more distantly related, lacking significant DNA homology and showing protein similarity to phiKMV in 48% of its gene products. The early region of the LKA1 genome has diverged strongly from phiKMV and LKD16, and intriguing differences in tail fiber genes of LKD16 and LKA1 likely reflect the observed discrepancy in infection-related properties. Nonetheless, general genome organization is clearly conserved among phiKMV, LKD16, and LKA1. The three phages carry a single-subunit RNA polymerase gene adjacent to the structural genome region, a feature which distinguishes them from other members of the T7 supergroup. Therefore, we propose that phiKMV represents an independent and widespread group of lytic P. aeruginosa phages within the T7 supergroup.	188	19	6924-31		Ceyssens;Lavigne;Mattheus;Chibeu;Hertveldt;Mast;Robben;Volckaert	Pieter-Jan;Rob;Wesley;Andrew;Kirsten;Jan;Johan;Guido	Division of Gene Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 21, Leuven B-3001, Belgium.	eng	Science. 1999 Dec 17;286(5448):2305-9;J Mol Evol. 2006 May;62(5):615-29;Trends Microbiol. 2000 Mar;8(3):120-8;Trends Genet. 2000 Jun;16(6):276-7;J Bacteriol. 2000 Sep;182(18):5114-20;J Bacteriol. 2000 Nov;182(21):6066-74;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Mar;39(5):1237-47;Bioinformatics. 2001 Jul;17(7):646-53;Comput Chem. 2001 Dec;26(1):51-6;J Bacteriol. 2002 May;184(10):2833-6;J Mol Biol. 2002 Jun 21;319(5):1115-32;J Bacteriol. 2002 Aug;184(16):4529-35;J Bacteriol. 2002 Sep;184(17):4891-905;Science. 2002 Oct 25;298(5594):728-31;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):799-808;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):898-911;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2003 Apr;69(4):2133-8;Virology. 2003 Jun 5;310(2):359-71;Virology. 2003 Jul 5;311(2):305-15;J Mol Biol. 2003 Jul 18;330(4):735-48;Virology. 2003 Jul 20;312(1):49-59;J Bacteriol. 2003 Sep;185(17):5248-62;J Mol Biol. 2004 Jan 30;335(5):1151-71;J Bacteriol. 2004 Apr;186(7):1933-44;Bioinformatics. 2004 Mar 22;20(5):629-35;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Apr 27;101(17):6415-20;J Mol Biol. 2004 Jul 16;340(4):783-95;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2004 Jul 15;236(2):249-56;Can J Microbiol. 1971 May;17(5):677-82;J Mol Biol. 1983 Jun 5;166(4):477-535;Science. 1989 Apr 7;244(4900):48-52;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;Gene. 1993 Jul 15;129(1):1-8;J Mol Biol. 1995 Jun 23;249(5):857-68;Gene. 1996 Feb 2;168(1):1-8;Mol Biol Evol. 1996 May;13(5):660-5;Microb Pathog. 1996 Sep;21(3):183-92;Biochem Soc Trans. 1996 Aug;24(3):893-6;Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom. 1997;11(9):1067-75;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Feb 15;26(4):1107-15;Bioinformatics. 1998;14(1):48-54;Mol Microbiol. 1999 May;32(4):715-27;Cell Mol Life Sci. 2004 Nov;61(21):2753-9;Science. 2005 Jan 7;307(5706):113-7;Trends Microbiol. 2005 Jun;13(6):278-84;Biotechniques. 2005 Sep;39(3):304, 306, 308;J Bacteriol. 2005 Dec;187(24):8499-503;J Biol Chem. 2005 Dec 9;280(49):40707-13;Microbiology. 2006 Feb;152(Pt 2):529-34;Genetika. 2006 Jan;42(1):33-8;Curr Opin Struct Biol. 2000 Feb;10(1):117-23	MEDLINE	ppublish

Microbiol.	1462-5814	Whole genome sequencing of a novel temperate bacteriophage of P. aeruginosa: evidence of tRNA gene mediating integration of the phage genome into the host bacterial chromosome.	Whole genome sequencing of a novel Pseudomonas aeruginosa temperate bacteriophage PaP3 has been completed. The genome contains 45 503 bp with GC content of 52.1%, without more than 100 bp sequence hitting homologue in all sequenced phage genomes. A total of 256 open reading frames (ORFs) are found in the genome, and 71 ORFs are predicated as coding sequence (CDS). All 71 CDS are divided into the two opposite direction groups, and both groups meet at the bidirectional terminator site locating the near middle of the genome. The genome is dsDNA with 5'-protruded cohesive ends and cohesive sequence is 'GCCGGCCCCTTTCCGCGTTA' (20 mer). There are four tRNA genes (tRNA(Asn), tRNA(Asp), tRNA(Tyr) and tRNA(Pro)) clustering at the 5'-terminal of the genome. Analysis of integration site of PaP3 in the host bacterial genome confirmed that the core sequence of (GGTCGTAGGTTCGAATCCTAC-21mer) locates at tRNA(Pro) gene within the attP region and at tRNA(Lys) gene in the attB region. The results indicated that 3'-end of tRNA(Pro) gene of the PaP3 genome is involved in the integration reaction and 5'-end of tRNA(Lys) gene of host bacteria genome is hot spot of the integration.	9	2	479-91		Tan;Zhang;Rao;Jin;Huang;Zhu;Chen;Hu;Shen;Wang;Hu	Yinling;Kebin;Xiancai;Xiaolin;Jianjun;Junmin;Zhijin;Xiaomei;Xiaodong;Lin;Fuquan	Department of Microbiology, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

In one approach, structural proteins of the phage were fractionated by SDS-PAGE for identification by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In a second approach, a whole-phage shotgun analysis (WSA) was applied. WSA uses trypsin digestion of whole phage particles, followed by reversed-phase HPLC and gas-phase fractionation of the complex peptide mixture prior to MS. The results yield a comprehensive view of structure-related proteins in phiKMV and suggest subtle structural differences from phage T7.	152	Pt 2	529-34		Lavigne;Noben;Hertveldt;Ceyssens;Briers;Dumont;Roucourt;Krylov;Mesyanzhinov;Robben;Volckaert	Rob;Jean-Paul;Kirsten;Pieter-Jan;Yves;Debora;Bart;Victor N;Vadim V;Johan;Guido	Laboratory of Gene Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 21, Leuven, B-3001, Belgium. rob.lavigne@biw.kuleuven.be	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Biol.	0022-2836	Genome comparison of Pseudomonas aeruginosa large phages.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage EL is a dsDNA phage related to the giant phiKZ-like Myoviridae. The EL genome sequence comprises 211,215 bp and has 201 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). The EL genome does not share DNA sequence homology with other viruses and micro-organisms sequenced to date. However, one-third of the predicted EL gene products (gps) shares similarity (Blast alignments of 17-55% amino acid identity) with phiKZ proteins. Comparative EL and phiKZ genomics reveals that these giant phages are an example of substantially diverged genetic mosaics. Based on the position of similar EL and phiKZ predicted gene products, five genome regions can be delineated in EL, four of which are relatively conserved between EL and phiKZ. Region IV, a 17.7 kb genome region with 28 predicted ORFs, is unique to EL. Fourteen EL ORFs have been assigned a putative function based on protein similarity. Assigned proteins are involved in DNA replication and nucleotide metabolism (NAD+-dependent DNA ligase, ribonuclease HI, helicase, thymidylate kinase), host lysis and particle structure. EL-gp146 is the first chaperonin GroEL sequence identified in a viral genome. Besides a putative transposase, EL harbours predicted mobile endonucleases related to H-N-H and LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases associated with group I intron and intein intervening sequences.	354	3	536-45		Hertveldt;Lavigne;Pleteneva;Sernova;Kurochkina;Korchevskii;Robben;Mesyanzhinov;Krylov;Volckaert	Kirsten;Rob;Elena;Natalia;Lidia;Roman;Johan;Vadim;Victor N;Guido	Laboratory of Gene Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 21, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium. kirsten.hertveldt@biw.kuleuven.be	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

U.S.A.	0027-8424	Comparison of the complete genome sequences of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B728a and pv. tomato DC3000.	The complete genomic sequence of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B728a (Pss B728a) has been determined and is compared with that of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000). The two pathovars of this economically important species of plant pathogenic bacteria differ in host range and other interactions with plants, with Pss having a more pronounced epiphytic stage of growth and higher abiotic stress tolerance and Pst DC3000 having a more pronounced apoplastic growth habitat. The Pss B728a genome (6.1 Mb) contains a circular chromosome and no plasmid, whereas the Pst DC3000 genome is 6.5 mbp in size, composed of a circular chromosome and two plasmids. Although a high degree of similarity exists between the two sequenced Pseudomonads, 976 protein-encoding genes are unique to Pss B728a when compared with Pst DC3000, including large genomic islands likely to contribute to virulence and host specificity. Over 375 repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences unique to Pss B728a when compared with Pst DC3000 are widely distributed throughout the chromosome except in 14 genomic islands, which generally had lower GC content than the genome as a whole. Content of the genomic islands varies, with one containing a prophage and another the plasmid pKLC102 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Among the 976 genes of Pss B728a with no counterpart in Pst DC3000 are those encoding for syringopeptin, syringomycin, indole acetic acid biosynthesis, arginine degradation, and production of ice nuclei. The genomic comparison suggests that several unique genes for Pss B728a such as ectoine synthase, DNA repair, and antibiotic production may contribute to the epiphytic fitness and stress tolerance of this organism.	102	31	11064-9		Feil;Feil;Chain;Larimer;DiBartolo;Copeland;Lykidis;Trong;Nolan;Goltsman;Thiel;Malfatti;Loper;Lapidus;Detter;Land;Richardson;Kyrpides;Ivanova;Lindow	Helene;William S;Patrick;Frank;Genevieve;Alex;Athanasios;Stephen;Matt;Eugene;James;Stephanie;Joyce E;Alla;John C;Miriam;Paul M;Nikos C;Natalia;Steven E	Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.	eng	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 May 25;101(21):8245-50;Phytopathology. 1999 May;89(5):353-9;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2001 Mar;14(3):336-48;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2001 Dec;14(12):1426-35;J Bacteriol. 1993 Mar;175(5):1257-63;J Bacteriol. 1996 Dec;178(23):6665-70;J Bacteriol. 1994 Mar;176(5):1374-82;Nat Biotechnol. 2005 Jul;23(7):873-8;Biochim Biophys Acta. 2002 May 20;1597(1):81-9;J Bacteriol. 2003 May;185(9):2759-73;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 1997 Nov;10(8):947-60;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1993 Apr;59(4):1018-24;Trends Plant Sci. 2003 May;8(5):197-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Feb 19;99(4):2275-80;J Bacteriol. 2004 Sep;186(17):5661-71;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 1999 Jun;63(2):266-92;J Biol Chem. 1998 Dec 4;273(49):32857-63;J Bacteriol. 1993 Oct;175(20):6451-8;Trends Microbiol. 2003 May;11(5):195-200;Microb Ecol. 2005 Jan;49(1):104-13;Bioinformatics. 2003 Nov 22;19(17):2225-36;Microbiology. 2002 Sep;148(Pt 9):2857-67;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Mar 2;101(9):3269-74;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2000 Sep;64(3):624-53;J Bacteriol. 1970 Jan;101(1):9-23;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 1998 Nov;11(11):1119-29;Arch Microbiol. 2000 Sep;174(3):135-42;J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):518-34;Microbiology. 2000 Oct;146 ( Pt 10):2469-80;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2003 Apr;6(2):173-80;Mol Microbiol. 2005 Jan;55(1):261-75;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Jul 27;101(30):11105-10;Plant Cell. 2001 Jan;13(1):153-61;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2000 Dec;66(12):5167-73;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Sep 2;100(18):10181-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Apr 15;30(8):1826-33;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2004 May;17(5):521-31;Biochimie. 2002 May-Jun;84(5-6):499-510;J Bacteriol. 1993 Mar;175(6):1656-64;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2003 Feb;6(1):20-8;Z Naturforsch C. 2000 May-Jun;55(5-6):328-32;J Mol Evol. 1999 Nov;49(5):627-44;Mol Plant Pathol. 2002 Nov 1;3(6):451-60;Nat Biotechnol. 2002 Nov;20(11):1118-23;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2004 Jan;17(1):90-7;J Bacteriol. 1990 Oct;172(10):5742-9;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2003 Dec;69(12):7273-80;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 1998 Feb;11(2):156-62	MEDLINE	ppublish

F116 is a temperate, pilus-specific, generalized transducing phage belonging to the Podoviridae virus family. Its genome is linear, ds, TR, and CP DNA with a GC content of 63.2%. The 65 195-bp genome contains 70 putative ORFs, only 16 of which showed sequence similarity to Pseudomonas genomic or phage genes. While the current literature suggests that F116 is a non-integrating phage that maintains itself as a plasmid during the lysogenic life cycle, a putative int gene was identified. Of the phage structural genes, only the portal protein could be identified by homology. Analysis of F116 structural protein by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE revealed approximately 15 bands. MALDI-TOF MS analysis identified the gene encoding the major capsid protein. This protein appears to undergo posttranslational cleavage giving rise to a smaller capsid protein.	346		187-94		Byrne;Kropinski	Michaela;Andrew M	Queen's University, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kingston, Ontario, Canada K7L 3N6.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Using the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Genome Project as a test case, we have developed a database and submission system to facilitate a community-based approach to continually updated genome annotation (http://www.pseudomonas.com). Researchers submit proposed annotation updates through one of three web-based form options which are then subjected to review, and if accepted, entered into both the database and log file of updates with author acknowledgement. In addition, a coordinator continually reviews literature for suitable updates, as we have found such reviews to be the most efficient. Both the annotations database and updates-log database have Boolean search capability with the ability to sort results and download all data or search results as tab-delimited files. To complement this peer-reviewed genome annotation, we also provide a linked GBrowse view which displays alternate annotations. Additional tools and analyses are also integrated, including PseudoCyc, and knockout mutant information. We propose that this database system, with its focus on facilitating flexible queries of the data and providing access to both peer-reviewed annotations as well as alternate annotation information, may be a suitable model for other genome projects wishing to use a continually updated, community-based annotation approach.

Life Sci.	1420-682X	Identification and characterization of a highly thermostable bacteriophage lysozyme.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage phiKMV is a T7-like lytic phage. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of the structural proteins revealed gene product 36 (gp36) as part of the phiKMV phage particle. The presence of a lysozyme domain in the C terminal of this protein (gp36C) was verified by turbidimetric assays on chloroform-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 and Escherichia coli WK6 cells. The molecular mass (20,884 Da) and pI (6.4) of recombinant gp36C were determined, as were the optimal enzymatic conditions (pH 6.0 in 16.7 mM phosphate buffer) and activity (4800 U/mg). Recombinant gp36C is a highly thermostable lysozyme, retaining 26% of its activity after 2 h at 100 degrees C and 21% after autoclaving. This thermostability could prove an interesting characteristic for food conservation technology.	61	21	2753-9		Lavigne;Briers;Hertveldt;Robben;Volckaert	R;Y;K;J;G	Laboratory of Gene Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 21, 3001 Leuven, Belgium.	eng	Hypertension. 2003 Nov;42(5):985-90;Prostaglandins. 1985 Apr;29(4):621-8;Circ Res. 1974 Nov;35(5):775-81;Circulation. 2001 Dec 18;104(25):3132-6;J Am Coll Cardiol. 2000 Mar 1;35(3):569-82;J Clin Invest. 2001 Oct;108(7):1023-30;Circ Res. 1993 Sep;73(3):413-23;Circulation. 2011 Jan 25;123(3):327-34;Hypertens Res. 2013 Jun;36(6):520-7;J Hypertens. 2012 Apr;30(4):778-86;Ann Med. 2010;42(1):79-86;J Biol Chem. 1998 Nov 27;273(48):31778-83;Jpn Circ J. 1990 May;54(5):507-14;Circ Res. 2002 Nov 29;91(11):988-98;J Hypertens. 2009 Sep;27(9):1823-8;Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2009 Sep;380(3):205-14;Hypertens Res. 2012 May;35(5):539-46;Hypertens Res. 2009 Mar;32(3):182-7;Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Aug 14;225(2):347-51;Front Biosci (Landmark Ed). 2012 Jan 01;17:221-31;J Hypertens. 2010 Sep;28 Suppl 1:S25-32;Diabetologia. 2012 Feb;55(2):520-9;Circ Res. 2002 Nov 1;91(9):776-81;Cardiovasc Res. 2009 Mar 1;81(4):780-7	MEDLINE	ppublish

Nucleic acids research	Nucleic Acids Res.	1362-4962	Unique features revealed by the genome sequence of Acinetobacter sp. ADP1, a versatile and naturally transformation competent bacterium.	Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 is a nutritionally versatile soil bacterium closely related to representatives of the well-characterized Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Unlike these bacteria, the Acinetobacter ADP1 is highly competent for natural transformation which affords extraordinary convenience for genetic manipulation. The circular chromosome of the Acinetobacter ADP1, presented here, encodes 3325 predicted coding sequences, of which 60% have been classified based on sequence similarity to other documented proteins. The close evolutionary proximity of Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas species, as judged by the sequences of their 16S RNA genes and by the highest level of bidirectional best hits, contrasts with the extensive divergence in the GC content of their DNA (40 versus 62%). The chromosomes also differ significantly in size, with the Acinetobacter ADP1 chromosome <60% of the length of the Pseudomonas counterparts. Genome analysis of the Acinetobacter ADP1 revealed genes for metabolic pathways involved in utilization of a large variety of compounds. Almost all of these genes, with orthologs that are scattered in other species, are located in five major 'islands of catabolic diversity', now an apparent 'archipelago of catabolic diversity', within one-quarter of the overall genome. Acinetobacter ADP1 displays many features of other aerobic soil bacteria with metabolism oriented toward the degradation of organic compounds found in their natural habitat. A distinguishing feature of this genome is the absence of a gene corresponding to pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that generally catalyzes the terminal step in conversion of carbohydrates to pyruvate for respiration by the citric acid cycle. This finding supports the view that the cycle itself is centrally geared to the catabolic capabilities of this exceptionally versatile organism.	32	19	5766-79		Barbe;Vallenet;Fonknechten;Kreimeyer;Oztas;Labarre;Cruveiller;Robert;Duprat;Wincker;Ornston;Weissenbach;Marlière;Cohen;Médigue	Valérie;David;Nuria;Annett;Sophie;Laurent;Stéphane;Catherine;Simone;Patrick;L Nicholas;Jean;Philippe;Georges N;Claudine	Genoscope and CNRS-UMR8030, 2 rue Gaston Crémieux, 91057 Evry, Cedex, France. vbarbe@genoscope.cns.fr	eng	FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1994 Dec 1;124(2):141-50;J Bacteriol. 1998 Sep;180(17):4466-74;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2003 Sep;69(9):5398-409;Genome Biol. 2001;2(9):RESEARCH0035;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Mar;85(6):1888-92;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):799-808;Mol Microbiol. 2003 May;48(4):855-61;J Mol Biol. 2001 Jan 19;305(3):567-80;J Biol Chem. 1961 May;236:1231-4;J Bacteriol. 1961 May;81:688-93;J Bacteriol. 1991 Nov;173(21):6844-8;Genome Res. 1998 Mar;8(3):195-202;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jul 1;31(13):3723-6;J Bacteriol. 1989 Jan;171(1):547-57;J Bacteriol. 1968 May;95(5):1520-41;J Bacteriol. 1995 Oct;177(20):5971-8;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2001 Dec;65(4):523-69, table of contents;J Bacteriol. 1999 Jun;181(11):3505-15;J Bacteriol. 2002 Jan;184(1):165-70;Mol Biol Evol. 2000 Aug;17(8):1268-75;Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2003 Jan;67(1):214-7;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1999 Oct;65(10):4568-74;J Biol Chem. 2002 Jun 14;277(24):21786-91;Genome Res. 1998 Mar;8(3):186-94;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Microbiol Rev. 1993 Dec;57(4):862-952;J Bacteriol. 1996 Dec;178(23):6833-41;Nature. 2002 Jan 31;415(6871):497-502;J Bacteriol. 2000 Apr;182(7):2018-25;J Bacteriol. 1961 May;81:694-703;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2001 Jul;67(7):3140-8;Microb Ecol. 2002 Apr;43(3):291-7;Eur J Biochem. 1997 Nov 1;249(3):820-5;Arch Microbiol. 1996 Aug;166(2):128-31;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Nov 15;31(22):6633-9;Eur J Biochem. 1999 Dec;266(2):683-90;J Bacteriol. 1998 Mar;180(6):1592-5;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004;32(19):5780-90;J Biol Chem. 1977 Aug 25;252(16):5839-46;Int J Syst Bacteriol. 1997 Jul;47(3):837-41;J Bacteriol. 1969 Sep;99(3):791-801;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jan 1;32(Database issue):D300-2;Protein Eng. 1999 Jan;12(1):3-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Jan 1;29(1):37-40;Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1961 Nov 2;94:952-9;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1987 Feb;53(2):440-6;J Bacteriol. 1997 Aug;179(16):5118-25;Microbiology. 1997 Apr;143 ( Pt 4):1345-57;Microbiology. 1995 Feb;141 ( Pt 2):431-9;Phytochemistry. 2001 Aug;57(7):1115-22;J Bacteriol. 1968 Jul;96(1):39-42;J Gen Microbiol. 1966 May;43(2):159-271;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1996;50:553-90;Chemotherapy. 2001 Jan-Feb;47(1):19-28;J Bacteriol. 1969 Apr;98(1):281-8;J Bacteriol. 1999 Jun;181(12):3688-94;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2003 Jan;16(1):74-82;Gene. 1994 Jan 28;138(1-2):59-65;J Hosp Infect. 2003 May;54(1):32-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Sep 2;100(18):10181-6;Arch Microbiol. 2003 Dec;180(6):385-93;Environ Microbiol. 2002 Dec;4(12):824-41;Arch Microbiol. 1994;162(4):249-54;Biochim Biophys Acta. 1967 Mar 22;136(2):245-7;Infect Immun. 2000 Jun;68(6):3657-66;Curr Microbiol. 2003 Apr;46(4):235-40;Bioinformatics. 2000 Oct;16(10):944-5;J Biol Chem. 2002 Jul 5;277(27):24490-8;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Mar;47(5):1291-304;Gene. 1995 Feb 3;153(1):111-5;Biochemistry. 2000 Oct 31;39(43):13223-32;J Bacteriol. 2000 Jul;182(13):3673-80;FEBS Lett. 2000 Dec 22;487(1):13-6;Microbiology. 1996 Jul;142 ( Pt 7):1825-31;Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Jan 1;29(1):123-5;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1982 Dec;44(6):1335-41;Arch Microbiol. 2000 Mar;173(3):220-8;Genome Res. 1998 Mar;8(3):175-85;J Bacteriol. 1999 Jun;181(11):3494-504;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Bioinformatics. 2003 Aug 12;19(12):1457-60;Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jan 1;32(Database issue):D115-9;J Bacteriol. 1984 Aug;159(2):570-8;J Bacteriol. 1992 Feb;174(3):1043-9	MEDLINE	epublish

In this report, we present the complete DNA sequence and annotation of the B3 genome. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the B3 genome is 38,439 bp long with a G+C content of 63.3%. The genome contains 59 proposed open reading frames (ORFs) organized into at least three operons. Of these ORFs, the predicted proteins from 41 ORFs (68%) display significant similarity to other phage or bacterial proteins. Many of the predicted B3 proteins are homologous to those encoded by the early genes and head genes of Mu and Mu-like prophages found in sequenced bacterial genomes. Only two of the predicted B3 tail proteins are homologous to other well-characterized phage tail proteins; however, several Mu-like prophages and transposable phage D3112 encode approximately 10 highly similar proteins in their predicted tail gene regions. Comparison of the B3 genomic organization with that of Mu revealed evidence of multiple genetic rearrangements, the most notable being the inversion of the proposed B3 immunity/early gene region, the loss of Mu-like tail genes, and an extreme leftward shift of the B3 DNA modification gene cluster. These differences illustrate and support the widely held view that tailed phages are genetic mosaics arising by the exchange of functional modules within a diverse genetic pool.	186	19	6560-74		Braid;Silhavy;Kitts;Cano;Howe	Michael D;Jennifer L;Christopher L;Raul J;Martha M	Biological Sciences Department and Environmental Biotechnology Institute, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, California, USA.	eng	J Bacteriol. 2004 Jan;186(2):400-10;Arch Virol. 2004 Feb;149(2):241-59;J Mol Biol. 2004 Jun 25;340(1):49-65;Microbiol Rev. 1979 Mar;43(1):73-102;Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1980;354:484-90;Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol. 1981;45 Pt 1:329-36;Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol. 1981;45 Pt 1:347-53;Science. 1981 Dec 4;214(4525):1133-5;Rev Infect Dis. 1983 Mar-Apr;5(2):279-313;Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1984;108:29-47;Clin Infect Dis. 1998 Aug;27 Suppl 1:S93-9;Mol Microbiol. 1998 Sep;29(5):1237-47;J Bacteriol. 1999 Feb;181(4):1110-7;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Mar 2;96(5):2192-7;Curr Opin Microbiol. 1998 Feb;1(1):27-35;Aust J Exp Biol Med Sci. 1960 Aug;38:321-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1963 Dec;50:1043-51;J Ultrastruct Res. 1964 Oct;11:274-81;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1999;53:245-81;Mol Microbiol. 2000 Jan;35(2):324-40;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2000 Feb;66(2):493-8;Pharmacol Ther. 1999 Dec;84(3):367-88;Science. 2000 Mar 10;287(5459):1809-15;Nucleic Acids Res. 1987 Mar 11;15(5):2343-61;J Bacteriol. 1989 Apr;171(4):2003-18;Virology. 1990 Jan;174(1):192-203;J Biomol Struct Dyn. 1986 Feb;3(4):705-23;J Bacteriol. 1990 Apr;172(4):1899-904;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;J Bacteriol. 1990 Dec;172(12):6641-50;Methods Enzymol. 1991;204:180-212;Methods Enzymol. 1991;204:485-514;J Bacteriol. 1994 Nov;176(22):6819-26;Science. 1995 Jul 28;269(5223):496-512;Virology. 1996 Mar 1;217(1):200-10;Mol Microbiol. 1996 Aug;21(4):675-82;J Bacteriol. 1997 May;179(10):3085-94;Genetika. 1997 Apr;33(4):553-5;Mol Microbiol. 1997 May;24(3):579-91;Mol Microbiol. 1997 Jun;24(6):1249-62;Infect Immun. 2000 Apr;68(4):2082-95;Nature. 2000 Mar 30;404(6777):502-6;J Mol Biol. 2000 May 26;299(1):27-51;Nature. 2000 Jul 13;406(6792):151-9;Nature. 2000 Aug 3;406(6795):477-83;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;J Biotechnol. 2001 Feb 13;85(2):103-13;Infect Immun. 2001 Apr;69(4):2580-8;DNA Res. 2001 Feb 28;8(1):11-22;Pac Symp Biocomput. 2001;:127-38;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Apr;40(2):271-83;Infect Immun. 2001 Jun;69(6):3523-35;Curr Opin Biotechnol. 2001 Jun;12(3):237-41;Nature. 2001 Oct 25;413(6858):848-52;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Mar 5;99(5):3159-64;J Mol Biol. 2002 Mar 29;317(3):337-59;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2002 Jun;5(3):246-53;J Bacteriol. 2002 Jul;184(14):4003-17;J R Soc Med. 2002;95 Suppl 41:22-6;J Bacteriol. 2002 Oct;184(20):5733-45;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Oct;46(1):157-68;Nat Biotechnol. 2002 Nov;20(11):1118-23;Infect Immun. 2002 Dec;70(12):7136-9;Genetika. 1984 Oct;20(10):1612-9;Genetika. 1985 May;21(5):724-34;Genetika. 1985 May;21(5):735-47;Virology. 1985 Jun;143(2):485-504;Virology. 1984 Apr 30;134(2):296-317;Gene. 1985;39(1):61-70;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1986;40:79-105;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Feb;84(3):699-703;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Can J Microbiol. 1997 Oct;43(10):981-5;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Jun 23;95(13):7345-50;J Comput Biol. 2002;9(5):707-20;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jan 1;31(1):383-7;Infect Immun. 2003 Mar;71(3):1590-5;Infect Immun. 2003 May;71(5):2404-13;Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Jun 20;306(1):310-7;Res Microbiol. 2003 May;154(4):253-7;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jul 1;31(13):3406-15;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Jul;49(2):277-300;Microbiology. 2003 Aug;149(Pt 8):2291-9;Genetika. 1980;16(6):975-84;J Virol. 1981 Jan;37(1):420-30;Nat Genet. 2003 Sep;35(1):32-40;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Sep 30;100(20):11660-5	MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriol.	0021-9193	Genomic diversity of Burkholderia pseudomallei clinical isolates: subtractive hybridization reveals a Burkholderia mallei-specific prophage in B. pseudomallei 1026b.	Burkholderia pseudomallei is the etiologic agent of the disease melioidosis and is a category B biological threat agent. The genomic sequence of B. pseudomallei K96243 was recently determined, but little is known about the overall genetic diversity of this species. Suppression subtractive hybridization was employed to assess the genetic variability between two distinct clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei, 1026b and K96243. Numerous mobile genetic elements, including a temperate bacteriophage designated phi1026b, were identified among the 1026b-specific suppression subtractive hybridization products. Bacteriophage phi1026b was spontaneously produced by 1026b, and it had a restricted host range, infecting only Burkholderia mallei. It possessed a noncontractile tail, an isometric head, and a linear 54,865-bp genome. The mosaic nature of the phi1026b genome was revealed by comparison with bacteriophage phiE125, a B. mallei-specific bacteriophage produced by Burkholderia thailandensis. The phi1026b genes for DNA packaging, tail morphogenesis, host lysis, integration, and DNA replication were nearly identical to the corresponding genes in phiE125. On the other hand, phi1026b genes involved in head morphogenesis were similar to head morphogenesis genes encoded by Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophages. Consistent with this observation, immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that polyclonal antiserum against phiE125 reacted with the tail of phi1026b but not with the head. The results presented here suggest that B. pseudomallei strains are genetically heterogeneous and that bacteriophages are major contributors to the genomic diversity of this species. The bacteriophage characterized in this study may be a useful diagnostic tool for differentiating B. pseudomallei and B. mallei, two closely related biological threat agents.	186	12	3938-50		DeShazer	David	United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fort Detrick, Maryland 21702, USA. david.deshazer@amedd.army.mil	eng	Microbiol Immunol. 2000;44(4):307-17;J Mol Biol. 2000 May 26;299(1):27-51;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2000 Sep;66(9):4139-41;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2000;54:799-825;J Bacteriol. 2000 Nov;182(21):6066-74;Clin Infect Dis. 2000 Oct;31(4):981-6;Microbiol Immunol. 1992;36(12):1239-49;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1993;47:597-626;Gene. 1994 May 27;143(1):145-6;Mikrobiologiia. 1994 May-Jun;63(3):537-44;Microbiology. 1994 Nov;140 ( Pt 11):2907-29;Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 1995 Jan-Feb;89(1):41-3;J Clin Microbiol. 1995 Mar;33(3):513-8;J Med Microbiol. 2000 Nov;49(11):993-1001;Infect Immun. 2001 Jan;69(1):34-44;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Jan;39(2):213-22;Science. 2001 May 11;292(5519):1096-9;Microb Pathog. 2001 May;30(5):253-69;EMBO Rep. 2001 May;2(5):376-81;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 1998 Mar;62(1):1-34;Int J Syst Bacteriol. 1998 Jan;48 Pt 1:317-20;Mol Microbiol. 1998 Aug;29(4):1065-76;Mol Microbiol. 1998 Dec;30(5):1081-100;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1999 May 15;174(2):247-50;J Clin Microbiol. 1999 Jul;37(7):2201-8;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2001 Sep;51(Pt 5):1709-13;J Bacteriol. 2002 Feb;184(3):849-52;Cell. 2002 Jan 11;108(1):13-6;Emerg Infect Dis. 2002 Feb;8(2):225-30;Arch Microbiol. 2002 Mar;177(3):267-73;Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2002 Apr;15(2):127-32;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2002 Mar;26(1):49-71;Biotechniques. 2002 May;32(5):992, 994, 996 passim;Gene. 2002 May 1;289(1-2):109-18;J Bacteriol. 2002 Jul;184(14):4003-17;J Med Microbiol. 2002 Jul;51(7):539-47;Trends Microbiol. 2002 Nov;10(11):521-9;Plasmid. 2002 Nov;48(3):202-12;J Bacteriol. 2003 Feb;185(3):1018-26;J Clin Microbiol. 2003 May;41(5):2068-79;Lancet. 2003 May 17;361(9370):1715-22;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2003 Jun;67(2):238-76, table of contents;Genome Res. 2003 Jun;13(6A):1042-55;Res Microbiol. 2003 May;154(4):245-51;Res Microbiol. 2003 May;154(4):253-7;Res Microbiol. 2003 May;154(4):277-82;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Jul;49(2):277-300;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2003 Aug;6(4):417-24;J Clin Microbiol. 2003 Oct;41(10):4647-54;J Bacteriol. 2003 Nov;185(22):6600-8;Nature. 1981 May 21;291(5812):238-9;Infect Immun. 1989 Mar;57(3):771-8;Annu Rev Genet. 1988;22:77-105;J Infect Dis. 1989 May;159(5):890-9;Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1991 Aug;35(8):1635-40;Plant Cell. 1991 Jan;3(1):49-59;Carbohydr Res. 1992 Sep 2;233:185-93;Science. 1995 Jun 30;268(5219):1899-902;Infect Immun. 1995 Sep;63(9):3348-52;Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 1995 Sep-Oct;89(5):488-90;J Bacteriol. 1997 Apr;179(7):2116-25;Mol Microbiol. 1997 Mar;23(6):1089-97;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;J Bacteriol. 1957 Nov;74(5):668-72;Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health. 2000;31 Suppl 1:146-52;J Clin Microbiol. 2000 Feb;38(2):910-3;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2000 Mar;50 Pt 2:743-9;Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2000 Mar;50 Pt 2:887-99;Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2000 Feb;62(2):232-9;Nature. 2000 May 18;405(6784):299-304	MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriol.	0021-9193	Complete sequence and evolutionary genomic analysis of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa transposable bacteriophage D3112.	Bacteriophage D3112 represents one of two distinct groups of transposable phage found in the clinically relevant, opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To further our understanding of transposable phage in P. aeruginosa, we have sequenced the complete genome of D3112. The genome is 37,611 bp, with an overall G+C content of 65%. We have identified 53 potential open reading frames, including three genes (the c repressor gene and early genes A and B) that have been previously characterized and sequenced. The organization of the putative coding regions corresponds to published genetic and transcriptional maps and is very similar to that of enterobacteriophage Mu. In contrast, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has classified D3112 as a lambda-like phage on the basis of its morphology. Similarity-based analyses identified 27 open reading frames with significant matches to proteins in the NCBI databases. Forty-eight percent of these were similar to Mu-like phage and prophage sequences, including proteins responsible for transposition, transcriptional regulation, virion morphogenesis, and capsid formation. The tail proteins were highly similar to prophage sequences in Escherichia coli and phage Phi12 from Staphylococcus aureus, while proteins at the right end were highly similar to proteins in Xylella fastidiosa. We performed phylogenetic analyses to understand the evolutionary relationships of D3112 with respect to Mu-like versus lambda-like bacteriophages. Different results were obtained from similarity-based versus phylogenetic analyses in some instances. Overall, our findings reveal a highly mosaic structure and suggest that extensive horizontal exchange of genetic material played an important role in the evolution of D3112.	186	2	400-10		Wang;Chu;Guttman	Pauline W;Linda;David S	Department of Botany, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S3B2 Canada.	eng	Genetika. 2000 Dec;36(12):1721-4;J Mol Biol. 2000 May 26;299(1):27-51;Mol Microbiol. 1994 May;12(3):343-50;Genetica. 1994;93(1-3):27-39;Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 Dec 27;1264(3):249-53;Comput Appl Biosci. 1996 Aug;12(4):357-8;J Mol Biol. 1996 Nov 22;264(1):46-55;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Nov 1;25(21):4385-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Dec 15;25(24):4876-82;Trends Biochem Sci. 1998 Nov;23(11):444-7;Science. 1999 May 21;284(5418):1318-22;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Oct 1;27(19):3911-20;Nucleic Acids Res. 2000 Jan 1;28(1):292;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Jan;39(2):213-22;Biotechniques. 2001 Feb;30(2):264-6;Infect Immun. 2001 Apr;69(4):2580-8;Bioinformatics. 2001 Aug;17(8):754-5;Trends Genet. 2000 Jun;16(6):276-7;Genetics. 1993 Jun;134(2):401-8;Virology. 2000 Jun 20;272(1):85-97;J Bacteriol. 2000 Nov;182(21):6066-74;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jan 1;30(1):235-8;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jan 1;30(1):276-80;Cell. 2002 Jan 11;108(1):13-6;Biotechniques. 2002 Jan;32(1):24-6, 28;J Mol Biol. 2002 Mar 29;317(3):337-59;J Bacteriol. 2002 Aug;184(16):4529-35;Theor Popul Biol. 2002 Jun;61(4):461-70;Theor Popul Biol. 2002 Jun;61(4):471-80;J Bacteriol. 2002 Sep;184(17):4891-905;Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 2002 Aug;82(1-4):73-91;J Bacteriol. 2002 Nov;184(21):6026-36;Nature. 1980 Jul 17;286(5770):218-22;Genetika. 1980;16(6):975-84;Mol Gen Genet. 1981;184(3):564-6;Mol Gen Genet. 1983;192(3):416-23;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1983 Dec;80(24):7400-4;Genetika. 1984 Oct;20(10):1612-9;Genetika. 1985 May;21(5):735-47;Genetika. 1988 May;24(5):956-9;J Bacteriol. 1989 Jul;171(7):3909-16;J Bacteriol. 1990 Apr;172(4):1899-904;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;Biochim Biophys Acta. 1991 Jan 17;1088(1):147-50;Nucleic Acids Res. 1991 Oct 11;19(19):5442;Gene. 1994 Mar 11;140(1):7-15	MEDLINE	ppublish

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.	0027-8424	The complete genome sequence of the Arabidopsis and tomato pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000.	We report the complete genome sequence of the model bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato DC3000 (DC3000), which is pathogenic on tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana. The DC3000 genome (6.5 megabases) contains a circular chromosome and two plasmids, which collectively encode 5,763 ORFs. We identified 298 established and putative virulence genes, including several clusters of genes encoding 31 confirmed and 19 predicted type III secretion system effector proteins. Many of the virulence genes were members of paralogous families and also were proximal to mobile elements, which collectively comprise 7% of the DC3000 genome. The bacterium possesses a large repertoire of transporters for the acquisition of nutrients, particularly sugars, as well as genes implicated in attachment to plant surfaces. Over 12% of the genes are dedicated to regulation, which may reflect the need for rapid adaptation to the diverse environments encountered during epiphytic growth and pathogenesis. Comparative analyses confirmed a high degree of similarity with two sequenced pseudomonads, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, yet revealed 1,159 genes unique to DC3000, of which 811 lack a known function.	100	18	10181-6		Buell;Joardar;Lindeberg;Selengut;Paulsen;Gwinn;Dodson;Deboy;Durkin;Kolonay;Madupu;Daugherty;Brinkac;Beanan;Haft;Nelson;Davidsen;Zafar;Zhou;Liu;Yuan;Khouri;Fedorova;Tran;Russell;Berry;Utterback;Van Aken;Feldblyum;D'Ascenzo;Deng;Ramos;Alfano;Cartinhour;Chatterjee;Delaney;Lazarowitz;Martin;Schneider;Tang;Bender;White;Fraser;Collmer	C Robin;Vinita;Magdalen;Jeremy;Ian T;Michelle L;Robert J;Robert T;A Scott;James F;Ramana;Sean;Lauren;Maureen J;Daniel H;William C;Tanja;Nikhat;Liwei;Jia;Qiaoping;Hoda;Nadia;Bao;Daniel;Kristi;Teresa;Susan E;Tamara V;Mark;Wen-Ling;Adela R;James R;Samuel;Arun K;Terrence P;Sondra G;Gregory B;David J;Xiaoyan;Carol L;Owen;Claire M;Alan	The Institute for Genomic Research, 9712 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA. rbuell@tigr.org	eng	Appl Environ Microbiol. 1995 Oct;61(10):3530-6;J Bacteriol. 1998 Feb;180(3):538-46;Nature. 2001 Jan 25;409(6819):529-33;Mol Plant Pathol. 2000 Sep 1;1(5):263-75;J Bacteriol. 1987 Feb;169(2):470-4;Phytopathology. 2002 Dec;92(12):1284-92;Science. 2001 Jul 20;293(5529):498-506;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 May 28;99(11):7652-7;Mol Microbiol. 1999 Apr;32(1):1-10;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Oct 1;99(20):13142-7;Nature. 2002 May 23;417(6887):459-63;Trends Microbiol. 2002 Oct;10(10):462-9;J Bacteriol. 1994 Mar;176(5):1374-82;Gene. 1997 Jun 11;192(1):7-11;Science. 2002 Mar 1;295(5560):1722-6;Microbiology. 1998 May;144 ( Pt 5):1133-43;Nature. 2001 Oct 4;413(6855):523-7;Mol Microbiol. 1999 Aug;33(4):712-20;Nature. 2000 Aug 31;406(6799):959-64;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Feb 19;99(4):2275-80;Trends Plant Sci. 2002 Sep;7(9):405-10;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 1999 Jun;63(2):266-92;Microbiol Rev. 1993 Dec;57(4):862-952;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1996;50:753-89;Nature. 2002 Jan 31;415(6871):497-502;Nature. 2001 Oct 25;413(6858):852-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jan 1;31(1):371-3;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Jan;82(2):406-10;Science. 2001 Dec 14;294(5550):2323-8;J Bacteriol. 2001 Feb;183(3):813-20;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2000 Sep;64(3):624-53;Appl Environ Microbiol. 2000 Jan;66(1):325-31;Mol Microbiol. 2003 Mar;47(6):1545-62;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Dec 1;27(23):4636-41;Nature. 2000 Jul 13;406(6792):151-9;J Bacteriol. 1986 Nov;168(2):512-22;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Sep;45(5):1207-18;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Sep 14;96(19):10875-80;Plant J. 2001 Jun;26(5):509-22;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2000 Oct;24(4):367-402;Microbiology. 2000 Oct;146 ( Pt 10):2375-84;Planta. 2001 Jun;213(2):241-9;Mol Cell. 2000 Jun;5(6):1003-11;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 1997 Apr;10(3):369-79;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Mar 27;98(7):4136-41;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2003 Feb;6(1):20-8;Science. 2001 Dec 14;294(5550):2317-23;Plant Cell. 1991 Jan;3(1):49-59;J Bacteriol. 1997 Jul;179(14):4464-72;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 1998 Nov;11(11):1048-56;Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Jan 1;30(1):276-80;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1986 Feb;51(2):323-7;Annu Rev Genet. 1990;24:447-63;Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 1998 Feb;11(2):156-62;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Annu Rev Microbiol. 2000;54:735-74;Mol Microbiol. 2001 Apr;40(2):271-83;Mol Microbiol. 2002 Apr;44(1):73-88	MEDLINE	ppublish

The complete DNA sequence of a new lytic T7-like bacteriophage phiKMV is presented. It is the first genome sequence of a member of the Podoviridae that infects Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The linear G + C-rich (62.3%) double-stranded DNA genome of 42,519 bp has direct terminal repeats of 414 bp and contains 48 open reading frames that are all transcribed from the same strand. Despite absence of homology at the DNA level, 11 of the 48 phiKMV-encoded putative proteins show sequence similarity to known T7-type phage proteins. Eighteen open reading frame products have been assigned, including an RNA polymerase, proteins involved in DNA replication, as well as structural, phage maturation, and lysis proteins. Surprisingly, the major capsid protein completely lacks sequence homology to any known protein. Also, the strong virulence toward many clinical P. aeruginosa isolates and a short replication time make phiKMV attractive for phage therapy or a potential source for antimicrobial proteins.	312	1	49-59		Lavigne;Burkal'tseva;Robben;Sykilinda;Kurochkina;Grymonprez;Jonckx;Krylov;Mesyanzhinov;Volckaert	Rob;Maria V;Johan;Nina N;Lidia P;Barbara;Bart;Victor N;Vadim V;Guido	Laboratory of Gene Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 21, Leuven, B-3001, Belgium.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Microbiol.	0923-2508	Myoviridae bacteriophages of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a long and complex evolutionary pathway.	Recently we have accomplished the entire DNA sequence of bacteriophage phiKZ, a giant virus infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The 280334-bp of phiKZ genome is a linear, circularly permutated and terminally redundant, AT-rich dsDNA molecule that contains no sites for NotI, PstI, SacI, SmaI, XhoI and XmaIII endonucleases. Limited homology to other bacteriophages on the DNA and protein levels indicated that phiKZ represents a distinct branch of the Myoviridae family. In this work, we analyzed a group of six P. aeruginosa phages (Lin68, Lin21, PTB80, NN, EL, and RU), which are morphologically similar to phiKZ, have similar genome size and low G+C content. All phages have a broad host range among P. aeruginosa strains, and they are resistant to the inhibitory action of many P. aeruginosa plasmids. The analysis of the genomic DNA by restriction enzymes and DNA-DNA hybridization shows that phages are representative of three phiKZ-like species: phiKZ-type (phiKZ, Lin21, NN and PTB80), EL-type (EL and RU) and Lin68 which has a shorter tail than other phages. Except for related phages EL and RU, all phiKZ-like phages have identical N-terminal amino acid sequences of the major capsid protein. Random genome sequencing shows that the EL and RU phages have no homology to the phiKZ-like phages on DNA level. We propose that the phiKZ, Lin21, NN, PTB80 and Lin68 phages can be included in a new phiKZ genus, and that the EL and RU phages belong to a separate genus within the Myoviridae family. Based on the resistance to many restriction enzymes and the transduction ability, there are indications that over the long pathway of evolution, the phiKZ-like phages probably inherited the capacity to infect different bacterial species.	154	4	269-75		Krylov;Pleteneva;Bourkaltseva;Shaburova;Volckaert;Sykilinda;Kurochkina;Mesyanzhinov	Victor;Elena;Maria;Olga;Guido;Nina;Lidia;Vadim	State Institute for Genetics of Industrial Microorganisms, 1st Dorozhnii proezd 1, 113545 Moscow, Russia. krylov@genetica.ru	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas putida is a metabolically versatile saprophytic soil bacterium that has been certified as a biosafety host for the cloning of foreign genes. The bacterium also has considerable potential for biotechnological applications. Sequence analysis of the 6.18 Mb genome of strain KT2440 reveals diverse transport and metabolic systems. Although there is a high level of genome conservation with the pathogenic Pseudomonad Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85% of the predicted coding regions are shared), key virulence factors including exotoxin A and type III secretion systems are absent. Analysis of the genome gives insight into the non-pathogenic nature of P. putida and points to potential new applications in agriculture, biocatalysis, bioremediation and bioplastic production.	4	12	799-808		Nelson;Weinel;Paulsen;Dodson;Hilbert;Martins dos Santos;Fouts;Gill;Pop;Holmes;Brinkac;Beanan;DeBoy;Daugherty;Kolonay;Madupu;Nelson;White;Peterson;Khouri;Hance;Chris Lee;Holtzapple;Scanlan;Tran;Moazzez;Utterback;Rizzo;Lee;Kosack;Moestl;Wedler;Lauber;Stjepandic;Hoheisel;Straetz;Heim;Kiewitz;Eisen;Timmis;Düsterhöft;Tümmler;Fraser	K E;C;I T;R J;H;V A P;D E;S R;M;M;L;M;R T;S;J;R;W;O;J;H;I;P;E;D;K;A;T;M;K;D;D;H;J;D;J;M;S;C;J A;K N;A;B;C M	The Institute for Genomic Research, 9712 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

A comparative study was made of a group of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulent giant DNA bacteriophages similar to phage phi KZ in several genetic and phenotypic properties (particle size, particle morphology, genome size, appearance of negative colonies, high productivity, broad spectrum of lytic activity, ability to overcome the suppressing effect of plasmids, absence of several DNA restriction sites, capability of general transduction, pseudolysogeny). We have recently sequenced the phage phi KZ genome (288,334 bp) [J. Mol. Biol., 2002, vol. 317, pp. 1-19]. By DNA homology, the phages were assigned to three species (represented by phage phi KZ, Lin68, and EL, respectively) and two new genera (phi KZ and EL). Restriction enzyme analysis revealed the mosaic genome structure in four phages of the phi KZ species (phi KZ, Lin21, NN, and PTB80) and two phages of the EL species (EL and RU). Comparisons with respect to phage particle size, number of structural proteins, and the N-terminal sequences of the major capsid protein confirmed the phylogenetic relatedness of the phages belonging to the phi KZ genus. The origin and evolution of the phi KZ-like phages are discussed. Analysis of protein sequences encoded by the phage phi KZ genome made it possible to assume wide migration of the phi KZ-like phages (wandering phages) among various prokaryotes and possibly eukaryotes. Since the phage phi KZ genome codes for potentially toxic proteins, caution must be exercised in the employment of large bacteriophages in phage therapy.	38	11	1470-9		Burkal'tseva;Krylov;Pleteneva;Shaburova;Krylov;Volkart;Sykilinda;Kurochkina;Mesianzhinov	M V;V N;E A;O V;S V;G;N N;L P;V V	State Research Institute of Genetics and Selection of Industrial Microorganisms, Moscow, 113545 Russia.	rus		MEDLINE	ppublish

Biochemistry	Biochemistry	0006-2960	ADP-ribosylation and functional effects of Pseudomonas exoenzyme S on cellular RalA.	Exoenzyme S (ExoS) is a bifunctional virulence factor directly translocated into eukaryotic cells by the type III secretory process of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacterial translocation of ExoS into epithelial cells is associated with diverse effects on cell function, including inhibition of growth, alterations in cell morphology, and effects on adherence processes. Preferred substrates of the ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) portion of ExoS include low molecular weight G-proteins (LMWG-proteins) in the Ras family. In examining the ADP-ribosylation and functional effects of ExoS on RalA, ExoS was found to ADP-ribosylate endogenous RalA and recombinant RalADeltaCAAX at multiple sites, with Arg52 identified as the preferred site of ADP-ribosylation. The binding of RalA to the Ral binding domain (RBD) of its downstream effector, RalBP1, was inhibited by bacterially translocated ExoS, indicating an effect of ExoS on cellular RalA function. In vitro analyses confirmed that ADP-ribosylation of RalA directly interfered with its ability to bind to the RBD of RalBP1. The studies support the fact that RalA is a cellular substrate of bacterially translocated ExoS and that ADP-ribosylation by ExoS affects RalA interaction with its downstream effector, RalBP1.	41	30	9680-7		Fraylick;Riese;Vincent;Barbieri;Olson	Jennifer E;Matthew J;Timothy S;Joseph T;Joan C	Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, 165 Ashley Avenue, Suite 309, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriophage phiKZ is a giant virus that efficiently infects Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains pathogenic to human and, therefore, it is attractive for phage therapy. We present here the complete phiKZ genome sequence and a preliminary analysis of its genome structure. The 280,334 bp genome is a linear, circularly permutated and terminally redundant, A+T-rich double-stranded DNA molecule. The phiKZ DNA has no detectable sequence homology to other viruses and microorganisms, and it does not contain NotI, PstI, SacI, SmaI, XhoI, and XmaIII endonuclease restriction sites. The genome has 306 open reading frames (ORFs) varying in size from 50 to 2237 amino acid residues. According to the orientation of transcription, ORFs are apparently organized into clusters and most have a clockwise direction. The phiKZ genome also encodes six tRNAs specific for Met (AUG), Asn (AAC), Asp (GAC), Leu (TTA), Thr (ACA), and Pro (CCA). A putative promoter sequence containing a TATATTAC block was identified. Most potential stem-loop transcription terminators contain the tetranucleotide UUCG loops. Some genes may be assigned as phage-encoded RNA polymerase subunits. Only 59 phiKZ gene products exhibit similarity to proteins of known function from a diversity of organisms. Most of these conserved gene products, such as dihydrofolate reductase, ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, thymidylate synthase, thymidylate kinase, and deoxycytidine triphosphate deaminase are involved in nucleotide metabolism. However, no virus-encoded DNA polymerase, DNA replication-associated proteins, or single-stranded DNA-binding protein were found based on amino acid homology, and they may therefore be strongly divergent from known homologous proteins. Fifteen phiKZ gene products show homology to proteins of pathogenic organisms, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria sp., Rickettsia prowazakeri, and Vibrio cholerae that must be considered before using this phage as a therapeutic agent. The phiKZ coat contains at least 40 polypeptides, and several proteins are cleaved during virus assembly in a way similar to phage T4. Eleven phiKZ-encoded polypeptides are related to proteins of other bacteriphages that infect a variety of hosts. Among these are four gene products that contain a putative intron-encoded endonuclease harboring the H-N-H motif common to many double-stranded DNA phages. These observations provide evidence that phages infecting diverse hosts have had access to a common genetic pool. However, limited homology on the DNA and protein levels indicates that bacteriophage phiKZ represents an evolutionary distinctive branch of the Myoviridae family.	317	1	1-19		Mesyanzhinov;Robben;Grymonprez;Kostyuchenko;Bourkaltseva;Sykilinda;Krylov;Volckaert	Vadim V;Johan;Barbara;Victor A;Maria V;Nina N;Victor N;Guido	Laboratory of Gene Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kardinaal Mercierlaan 92, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium. vvm@bch.ru	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

We present the first description of a single-stranded DNA filamentous phage able to replicate in a gram-positive bacterium. Phage B5 infects Propionibacterium freudenreichii and has a genome consisting of 5,806 bases coding for 10 putative open reading frames. The organization of the genome is very similar to the organization of the genomes of filamentous phages active on gram-negative bacteria. The putative coat protein exhibits homology with the coat proteins of phages PH75 and Pf3 active on Thermus thermophilus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. B5 is, therefore, evolutionarily related to the filamentous phages active on gram-negative bacteria.	184	7	2030-3		Chopin;Rouault;Ehrlich;Gautier	Marie-Christine;Annette;S Dusko;Michel	INRA, Laboratoire de Génétique Microbienne, 78352 Jouy-en-Josas Cedex, France. mchopin@jouy.inra.fr	eng	EMBO J. 1999 Nov 15;18(22):6299-306;Science. 1999 May 28;284(5419):1516-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Jul 31;98(16):9359-64;J Dairy Sci. 1968 Oct;51(10):1707-9;Virology. 1973 Sep;55(1):20-38;J Mol Biol. 1981 Mar 25;147(1):195-7;Gene. 1981 Dec;16(1-3):35-58;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Sep;79(17):5200-4;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Feb;81(3):699-703;EMBO J. 1982;1(8):945-51;J Mol Biol. 1985 Jan 5;181(1):27-39;J Virol. 1985 Oct;56(1):268-76;J Virol. 1990 May;64(5):2082-9;J Bacteriol. 1991 Jan;173(2):530-5;J Biol Chem. 1991 Feb 5;266(4):2104-11;Mol Microbiol. 1991 Jul;5(7):1607-13;Genomics. 1991 Nov;11(3):635-50;Nucleic Acids Res. 1992 Jul 11;20(13):3279-85;Protein Sci. 1995 Mar;4(3):521-33;J Mol Biol. 1995 Jul 21;250(4):496-506;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1995 Jul;61(7):2572-6;Trends Microbiol. 1995 Jun;3(6):223-8;Gene. 1997 Jun 11;192(1):23-32;Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 1997 Dec;61(4):442-55;J Bacteriol. 1998 Jun;180(12):3233-6;Curr Opin Struct Biol. 1998 Apr;8(2):150-8;Microbiology. 1998 Jul;144 ( Pt 7):1901-6;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Mar 2;96(5):2192-7;J Mol Biol. 2001 Jun 1;309(2):401-21	MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriol.	0021-9193	Sequence of the genome of the temperate, serotype-converting, Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage D3.	Temperate bacteriophage D3, a member of the virus family Siphoviridae, is responsible for serotype conversion in its host, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The complete sequence of the double-stranded DNA genome has been determined. The 56,426 bp contains 90 putative open reading frames (ORFs) and four genes specifying tRNAs. The latter are specific for methionine (AUG), glycine (GGA), asparagine (AAC), and threonine (ACA). The tRNAs may function in the translation of certain highly expressed proteins from this relatively AT-rich genome. D3 proteins which exhibited a high degree of sequence similarity to previously characterized phage proteins included the portal, major head, tail, and tail tape measure proteins, endolysin, integrase, helicase, and NinG. The layout of genes was reminiscent of lambdoid phages, with the exception of the placement of the endolysin gene, which parenthetically also lacked a cognate holin. The greatest sequence similarity was found in the morphogenesis genes to coliphages HK022 and HK97. Among the ORFs was discovered the gene encoding the fucosamine O-acetylase, which is in part responsible for the serotype conversion events.	182	21	6066-74		Kropinski	A M	Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada. kropinski@post.queensu.ca	eng	J Biol Chem. 1992 Jul 15;267(20):14388-97;Microbiol Rev. 1992 Sep;56(3):430-81;J Mol Biol. 1992 Nov 20;228(2):529-38;Aust J Exp Biol Med Sci. 1960 Aug;38:321-9;J Bacteriol. 1962 Dec;84:1321-4;J Mol Biol. 1964 Jan;8:1-10;J Mol Biol. 1982 Dec 25;162(4):729-73;J Bacteriol. 1983 Jul;155(1):203-12;Nucleic Acids Res. 1984 May 25;12(10):4411-27;J Mol Biol. 1985 Jan 5;181(1):75-84;J Mol Biol. 1985 Jan 5;181(1):85-91;Nucleic Acids Res. 1993 Feb 11;21(3):781-2;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1999 Nov 15;180(2):305-10;J Bacteriol. 1999 Dec;181(23):7221-7;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2000 Jan 15;182(2):271-7;J Biol Chem. 2000 Jan 14;275(2):769-76;J Mol Biol. 2000 May 26;299(1):27-51;J Mol Biol. 1967 Dec 28;30(3):445-55;J Mol Biol. 1967 Dec 28;30(3):457-75;J Mol Biol. 1969 Jun 14;42(2):237-46;J Mol Biol. 1968 May 28;34(1):1-16;Virology. 1974 Jun;59(2):566-9;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1979 Oct;38(4):626-36;Mol Gen Genet. 1982;188(2):292-8;Annu Rev Biochem. 1993;62:893-930;Nucleic Acids Res. 1994 Jun 11;22(11):2079-88;J Bacteriol. 1994 Aug;176(16):4809-15;J Bacteriol. 1994 Aug;176(16):5033-43;Nucleic Acids Res. 1994 Nov 11;22(22):4673-80;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1994;48:193-222;Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 Feb 22;1247(1):149-58;J Biol Chem. 1995 Jul 21;270(29):17622-6;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 1995 Aug;17(1-2):109-19;FEMS Microbiol Rev. 1995 Aug;17(1-2):191-205;FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1995 Sep 15;131(3):301-6;Mol Microbiol. 1996 Jul;21(1):69-76;Gene. 1996 Oct 24;177(1-2):47-53;J Mol Biol. 1996 Nov 22;264(1):46-55;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Mar 1;25(5):955-64;Can J Microbiol. 1997 Mar;43(3):220-6;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;J Biol Chem. 1998 Feb 13;273(7):4143-8;Virology. 1998 Feb 15;241(2):345-56;J Mol Biol. 1998 Feb 13;276(1):151-64;Mol Gen Genet. 1998 Oct;259(6):679-88;Nucleic Acids Res. 1999 Jan 1;27(1):215-9;Mol Microbiol. 1999 Jan;31(2):399-419;Virology. 1999 Mar 1;255(1):63-76;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Mar 2;96(5):2192-7;J Bacteriol. 1999 Mar;181(6):1767-78;J Bacteriol. 1999 Aug;181(15):4452-60;Gene. 1999 Aug 20;236(2):333-46;DNA Res. 1999 Aug 31;6(4):235-40;Can J Microbiol. 1999 Sep;45(9):791-6;J Biol Chem. 1985 Sep 25;260(21):11838-44;J Bacteriol. 1986 Feb;165(2):448-52;J Bacteriol. 1987 May;169(5):1847-52;Gene. 1987;52(1):51-7;J Biomol Struct Dyn. 1986 Feb;3(4):705-23;J Bacteriol. 1990 Jun;172(6):3509-11;J Clin Microbiol. 1990 May;28(5):922-5;Nucleic Acids Res. 1990 Sep 11;18(17):4993-5000;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;Vet Q. 1991 Apr;13(2):97-104;J Mol Biol. 1992 Mar 5;224(1):31-51;J Mol Evol. 1992 Apr;34(4):351-7;Nucleic Acids Res. 1992 May 11;20 Suppl:2013-8	MEDLINE	ppublish

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections. A major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. Here we report the complete sequence of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. At 6.3 million base pairs, this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced, and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of P. aeruginosa. Consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability, P. aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism, transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems. We propose that the size and complexity of the P. aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances.	406	6799	959-64		Stover;Pham;Erwin;Mizoguchi;Warrener;Hickey;Brinkman;Hufnagle;Kowalik;Lagrou;Garber;Goltry;Tolentino;Westbrock-Wadman;Yuan;Brody;Coulter;Folger;Kas;Larbig;Lim;Smith;Spencer;Wong;Wu;Paulsen;Reizer;Saier;Hancock;Lory;Olson	C K;X Q;A L;S D;P;M J;F S;W O;D J;M;R L;L;E;S;Y;L L;S N;K R;A;K;R;K;D;G K;Z;I T;J;M H;R E;S;M V	PathoGenesis Corporation, Seattle, Washington 98119, USA.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

The terminal DNA restriction fragments (PstI-D and -B) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage D3 were ligated, cloned, and sequenced. Of the nine open reading frames in this 8.3-kb fragment, four were identified as encoding large-subunit terminase, portal, ClpP protease, and major head proteins. The portal and capsid proteins showed significant homology with proteins of the lambdoid coliphage HK97. Phage D3 was purified by CsCl equilibrium gradient centrifugation (rho = 1.533 g/ml), and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed six proteins with molecular masses of 186, 91, 79, 70, 45, and 32 kDa. The pattern was unusual, since a major band corresponding to the expected head protein (43 kDa) was missing and a significant amount of the protein was retained in the stacking gel. The amino terminus of the 186-kDa protein was sequenced, revealing that the D3 head is composed of cross-linked 31-kDa protein subunits, resulting from the proteolysis of the 43-kDa precursor. This is identical to the situation observed with coliphage HK97.	181	23	7221-7		Gilakjan;Kropinski	Z A;A M	Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada.	eng	Biochim Biophys Acta. 1965 Sep 6;108(1):18-29;Bioinformatics. 1998;14(1):48-54;Virology. 1970 Mar;40(3):734-44;Nature. 1970 Aug 15;227(5259):680-5;Virology. 1974 Jun;59(2):566-9;J Bacteriol. 1983 Jul;155(1):203-12;Nature. 1983 Aug 25-31;304(5928):703-8;J Virol. 1985 Oct;56(1):268-76;J Bacteriol. 1986 Feb;165(2):448-52;J Bacteriol. 1986 Jun;166(3):1134-6;Gene. 1987;52(1):51-7;Gene. 1998 Jul 17;215(1):57-67;Cell. 1998 Jul 10;94(1):55-60;J Mol Biol. 1998 Aug 7;281(1):69-79;J Mol Biol. 1998 Aug 14;281(2):219-25;Genetika. 1998 May;34(5):697-700;Genetika. 1998 Jun;34(6):846-9;J Mol Biol. 1998 Dec 4;284(3):661-72;Adv Virus Res. 1998;51:135-201;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Mar 2;96(5):2192-7;J Bacteriol. 1999 Mar;181(5):1630-5;Genes Dev. 1988 Feb;2(2):184-95;J Bacteriol. 1990 Jun;172(6):3509-11;Eur J Biochem. 1990 Jun 20;190(2):233-48;J Mol Biol. 1990 Oct 5;215(3):403-10;J Mol Biol. 1990 Dec 5;216(3):701-16;J Struct Biol. 1990 Jul-Sep;104(1-3):24-31;Virology. 1991 Aug;183(2):519-38;Mol Microbiol. 1993 Feb;7(3):395-405;EMBO J. 1993 Apr;12(4):1303-9;Arch Virol. 1993;131(1-2):141-51;Nucleic Acids Res. 1993 Jul 1;21(13):3097-103;Virology. 1994 May 1;200(2):744-51;J Bacteriol. 1994 Aug;176(16):4809-15;Annu Rev Microbiol. 1994;48:193-222;Comput Appl Biosci. 1994 Sep;10(5):569-70;J Mol Biol. 1995 Apr 7;247(4):618-35;J Mol Biol. 1995 Apr 7;247(4):636-47;J Mol Biol. 1995 Oct 13;253(1):86-99;J Bacteriol. 1996 Feb;178(3):902-5;Arch Virol. 1996;141(2):209-18;Gene. 1996 Oct 24;177(1-2):47-53;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Jan 1;25(1):217-21;Biol Chem. 1996 Sep;377(9):549-54;Can J Microbiol. 1997 Mar;43(3):220-6;Comput Appl Biosci. 1997 Jun;13(3):227-30;Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Sep 1;25(17):3389-402;Genetics. 1997 Sep;147(1):7-17;Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Feb 15;26(4):1107-15;Adv Virus Res. 1998;50:235-88;Biochemistry. 1998 May 26;37(21):7778-86;J Mol Biol. 1968 Mar 28;32(3):513-20	MEDLINE	ppublish

Microbiol.	0950-382X	The complete nucleotide sequence of phi CTX, a cytotoxin-converting phage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: implications for phage evolution and horizontal gene transfer via bacteriophages.	phi CTX is a cytotoxin-converting phage isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the phi CTX phage genome. The precise genome size was 35,538 bp with 21 base 5'-extruding cohesive ends. Forty-seven open reading frames (ORFs) were identified on the phi CTX genome, including two previously identified genes, ctx and int. Among them, 15 gene products were identified in the phage particle by protein microsequencing. The most striking feature of the phi CTX genome was an extensive homology with the coliphage P2 and P2-related phages; more than half of the ORFs (25 ORFs) had marked homology to P2 genes with 28.9-65.8% identity. The gene arrangement on the genome was also highly conserved for the two phages, although the G + C content and codon usage of most phi CTX genes were similar to those of the host P. aeruginosa chromosome. In addition, phi CTX was found to share several common features with P2, including the morphology, non-inducibility, use of lipopolysaccharide core oligosaccharide as receptor and Ca(2+)-dependent receptor binding. These findings indicate that phi CTX is a P2-like phage well adapted to P. aeruginosa, and provide clear evidence of the intergeneric spread and evolution of bacteriophages. Furthermore, comparative analysis of genome structures of phi CTX, P2 and other P2 relatives revealed the presence of several hot-spots where foreign DNAs, including the cytotoxin gene, were inserted. They appear to be deeply concerned in the acquisition of various genes that are horizontally transferred by bacteriophage infection.	31	2	399-419		Nakayama;Kanaya;Ohnishi;Terawaki;Hayashi	K;S;M;Y;T	Department of Bacteriology, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Virology	Virology	0042-6822	Nucleotide sequence of a single-stranded RNA phage from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: kinship to coliphages and conservation of regulatory RNA structures.	We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the single-stranded RNA phage PP7 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There are three open reading frames which code for apparent protein homologues of the single-stranded RNA coliphages, i.e., maturation protein, coat protein, and replicase. A fourth overlapping reading frame exists that probably encodes a lysis protein, similar to what has been found in the group A coliphages such as MS2. The genetic map of PP7 is colinear with group A coliphages and we accordingly classify the phage as a levivirus. There is, generally speaking, no significant nucleotide sequence identity between PP7 and the coliphages except for a few regions where homologous parts of proteins are encoded, most notable in the replicase gene. In these regions the nucleotide sequence similarity between PP7 and MS2 is no greater than between PP7 and the group B coliphages such as Q beta. Surprisingly, Q beta and MS2 are no closer to each other than they are to PP7. Several regulatory RNA secondary structure features that are present in the coliphages were identified also in PP7 RNA although the sequences involved cannot be aligned. Among these are the coat protein binding helix at the start of the replicase gene, structures at the 5' and 3' terminus of the RNA, a replicase binding site, and the structure of the coat protein cistron start. Some of these features resemble MS2 type coliphages but others the Q beta type. These findings suggest that PP7 is related to the coliphages but branched off before the coliphages diverged into separate groups.	206	1	611-25		Olsthoorn;Garde;Dayhuff;Atkins;Van Duin	R C;G;T;J F;J	Department of Biochemistry, Leiden Institute of Chemistry (LIC), Leiden University, The Netherlands.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

The genome of the class II filamentous bacteriophage Pf1 has been sequenced by a combination of the chain termination and chemical degradation methods. It consists of 7349 nucleotides in a closed, circular loop of single-stranded DNA. The size and position of its open reading frames (ORFs) in general resemble those of other filamentous bacteriophage genomes. The size and position of the spaces between the ORFs have not been conserved, however, and six short reading frames (2 of which overlap) occupy a region corresponding to that filled by genes 2 and 10 in the Ff genome. Most of the ORFs are preceded by sequences resembling ribosome binding sites from the phage's host. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that appear to differ somewhat from their counterparts in Escherichia coli. A search for sequences related to known pseudomonad promoters suggests that the promoters in this bacteriophage may well be ntr-dependent, with the two strongest preceding the gene for the major coat protein (gene 8) and another ORF (430). Gene 8 is followed by a sequence with the properties of a rho-independent terminator of transcription, like that at the same position in the genome of Ff. The Pf1 genome contains no collection of potential stem-and-loop structures corresponding to those that initiate replication of Ff DNA and assembly of the Ff virion, although isolated structures of this kind are present. The available evidence suggests that at least 13 of the 14 major ORFs are expressed. Overall, the organization of the Pf1 genome differs from that of the other class II filamentous phage whose genome has been sequenced, Pf3, as much as it does from that of the class I phages Ff and IKe.	218	2	349-64		Hill;Short;Perham;Petersen	D F;N J;R N;G B	Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Microbiol.	0950-382X	Gene sequences and comparison of the fimbrial subunits representative of Bacteroides nodosus serotypes A to I: class I and class II strains.	We have determined the nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding the fimbrial subunits representative of the known Bacteroides nodosus serogroups. All of the genes are preceded by a highly conserved region which includes the likely promoter and transcriptional regulator sites as well as the ribosome-biding site, and are followed within a short but variable distance by a sequence with the characteristics of a transcription termination or attenuation signal. Based on sequence and organization, the subunits can be divided into two major classes called I (serogroups A, B, C, E, F, G, and I) and II (serogroups D and H). All contain the same seven-amino-acid positively charged leader sequence and conserved hydrophobic amino-terminal sequence typical of type 4 fibriae. Beyond this point the class II subunits are quite different from class I and share features more in common with those from other type 4 fimbriate bacteria, such as Moraxella bovis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The larger class I may be further subdivided into two subsets: (i) [A, E, F)(B, I)) and (ii) (C, G). These proteins exhibit three major clusters of variation, at either end of the presumptive disulphide loop which spans the central third of the protein, and near the carboxy-terimus, with dispersed changes in between. The length of the mature subunits varies from 152-156 amino acids, and the variation includes small insertions or deletions in the variable clusters between more conserved domains. The class II subunits are 149 amino acids in length and contain two pairs of cysteine residues: one is at the end of the amino-terminal conserved region, and the other is at the end of the protein. The major variation occurs in the central region of the molecule, and again small insertions or deletions are required to align adjacent conserved domains. There is also a striking absence of silent codon changes in the 5' coding region of all of these genes, indicating that these sequences have a secondary genetic function, probably in recombinational exchange.	5	3	561-73		Mattick;Anderson;Cox;Dalrymple;Bills;Hobbs;Egerton	J S;B J;P T;B P;M M;M;J R	Centre for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Bacteriol.	0021-9193	Products of three accessory genes, pilB, pilC, and pilD, are required for biogenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pili.	The polar pili of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are composed of monomers of the pilin structural subunits. The biogenesis of pili involves the synthesis of pilin precursor, cleavage of a six-amino-acid leader peptide, membrane translocation, and assembly of monomers into a filamentous structure extending from the bacterial surface. This report describes three novel genes necessary for the formation of pili. DNA sequences adjacent to pilA, the pilin structural gene, were cloned and mutagenized with transposon Tn5. Each of the insertions were introduced into the chromosome of P. aeruginosa PAK by gene replacement. The effect of the Tn5 insertions in the bacterial chromosome on pilus assembly was assessed by electron microscopy and sensitivity of mutants to a pilus-specific bacteriophage. The resultant mutants were also tested for synthesis and membrane localization of the pilin antigen in order to define the genes required for maturation, export, and assembly of pilin. A 4.0-kilobase-pair region of DNA adjacent to the pilin structural gene was found to be essential for formation of pili. This region was sequenced and found to contain three open reading frames coding for 62-, 38- to 45-, and 28- to 32-kilodalton proteins (pilB, pilC, and pilD, respectively). Three proteins of similar molecular weight were expressed in Escherichia coli from the 4.0-kilobase-pair fragment flanking pilA with use of a T7 promoter-polymerase expression system. The results of the analyses of the three genes and the implications for pilin assembly and maturation are discussed.	172	6	2911-9		Nunn;Bergman;Lory	D;S;S	Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.	eng	Biochim Biophys Acta. 1986 Jan 30;869(2):197-214;J Bacteriol. 1985 Oct;164(1):446-55;J Biol Chem. 1986 Nov 25;261(33):15703-8;J Bacteriol. 1987 Jul;169(7):3181-8;J Bacteriol. 1987 Dec;169(12):5663-7;Gene. 1988;62(2):219-27;Infect Immun. 1988 Jun;56(6):1641-6;J Bacteriol. 1988 Jun;170(6):2575-83;Vaccine. 1988 Apr;6(2):151-4;Mol Microbiol. 1988 Jul;2(4):489-95;Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1988;54(4):285-99;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Mar;86(6):1954-7;J Infect Dis. 1990 Mar;161(3):541-8;J Bacteriol. 1950 Jul;60(1):17-28;Nature. 1970 Aug 15;227(5259):680-5;Virology. 1973 Feb;51(2):489-92;Cell. 1977 Jul;11(3):551-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1977 Dec;74(12):5463-7;J Bacteriol. 1978 Oct;136(1):381-90;Nucleic Acids Res. 1979 Nov 24;7(6):1513-23;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Sep;76(9):4350-4;Infect Immun. 1980 Sep;29(3):1146-51;Nature. 1981 Jan 1;289(5793):85-8;J Biol Chem. 1982 Aug 10;257(15):8724-30;J Mol Biol. 1982 May 5;157(1):105-32;Rev Infect Dis. 1983 Mar-Apr;5(2):279-313;FEBS Lett. 1983 Nov 28;164(1):149-53;J Bacteriol. 1984 Jan;157(1):330-3;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Oct;81(19):6110-4;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Feb;82(4):1074-8;J Bacteriol. 1985 Jul;163(1):132-9;J Bacteriol. 1986 Feb;165(2):367-72	MEDLINE	ppublish

A gene cluster encoding biphenyl- and chlorobiphenyl-degrading enzymes was cloned from a soil pseudomonad into Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1161. Chromosomal DNA from polychlorinated biphenyl-degrading Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 was digested with restriction endonuclease XhoI and cloned into the unique XhoI site of broad-host-range plasmid pKF330. Of 8,000 transformants tested, only 1, containing the chimeric plasmid pMFB1, rendered the host cell able to convert biphenyls and chlorobiphenyls to ring meta cleavage compounds via dihydrodiols and dihydroxy compounds. The chimeric plasmid contained a 7.9-kilobase XhoI insert. Subcloning experiments revealed that the genes bphA (encoding biphenyl dioxygenase), bphB (encoding dihydrodiol dehydrogenase), and bphC (encoding 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase) were coded for by the 7.9-kilobase fragment. The gene order was bphA-bphB-bphC. The hydrolase activity, which converted the intermediate meta cleavage compounds to the final product, chlorobenzoic acids, and was encoded by a putative bphD gene, was missing from the cloned 7.9-kilobase fragment.	166	2	392-8		Furukawa;Miyazaki	K;T		eng	J Bacteriol. 1978 Jun;134(3):757-64;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Feb;79(3):874-8;Mol Gen Genet. 1984;197(3):373-83;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1982 Sep;44(3):619-26;Basic Life Sci. 1984;28:47-80;Can J Microbiol. 1973 Jan;19(1):47-52;Experientia. 1971 Oct 15;27(10):1173-4;J Bacteriol. 1968 Nov;96(5):1488-99;J Bacteriol. 1983 Oct;156(1):89-94;Mol Gen Genet. 1982;188(2):279-85;Gene. 1984 Feb;27(2):173-81;J Bacteriol. 1985 Sep;163(3):882-9;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Dec;78(12):7458-62;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1979 Aug;38(2):301-10;J Mol Biol. 1975 Nov 5;98(3):503-17;Appl Environ Microbiol. 1978 Feb;35(2):223-7;J Bacteriol. 1983 Sep;155(3):1192-9;Nucleic Acids Res. 1979 Nov 24;7(6):1513-23;J Bacteriol. 1983 Jun;154(3):1356-62;J Bacteriol. 1982 Apr;150(1):195-201;No Shinkei Geka. 1978 Jun;6(6):543-8;Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1982;96:47-67;Plasmid. 1983 Mar;9(2):112-25	MEDLINE	ppublish

Virol.	0022-538X	Nucleotide sequence of the genome of Pf3, an IncP-1 plasmid-specific filamentous bacteriophage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	The circular, single-stranded DNA genome of the Pf3 bacteriophage was sequenced in its entirety by each of two methods, the M13-dideoxy chain termination method and the chemical degradation method. It consists of 5,833 nucleotides. With respect to both the DNA and the protein sequences, there is virtually no homology between Pf3 and the phages Ff (M13, f1, and fd) and IKe. However, similarities between these phages were noted with respect to their overall genome organizations. The gene for the single-stranded DNA-binding protein is followed by the gene for the major coat protein and then by a transcription termination signal. Open reading frames for seven other proteins were predicted, and their sizes and order show a fair correspondence to the sizes and order of the genes of the Ff phages and IKe. In addition, several regions have the potential to form stem and loop structures similar to those in the intergenic region of the Ff phage genome, but in Pf3 some are within open reading frames. Evolutionary relationships between Pf3 and the Ff phages and IKe are thus apparent through the correspondence of overall gene order rather than through primary sequence homologies.	56	1	268-76		Luiten;Putterman;Schoenmakers;Konings;Day	R G;D G;J G;R N;L A		eng	J Mol Biol. 1974 Jan 15;82(2):121-38;Gene. 1982 Oct;19(3):269-76;Anal Biochem. 1983 Feb 15;129(1):216-23;Biophys J. 1983 May;42(2):171-80;J Virol. 1983 Jul;47(1):221-3;Nucleic Acids Res. 1983 Nov 25;11(22):8073-85;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Feb;81(3):699-703;Nucleic Acids Res. 1984 May 25;12(10):4071-81;J Mol Biol. 1985 Jan 5;181(1):27-39;J Gen Microbiol. 1974 Oct;84(2):332-42;J Mol Biol. 1974 Sep 25;88(3):581-98;Nature. 1975 Mar 6;254(5495):34-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1976 Jan;73(1):49-53;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1977 Feb;74(2):560-4;Nature. 1979 Mar 22;278(5702):365-7;Nucleic Acids Res. 1978 Dec;5(12):4495-503;Nucleic Acids Res. 1980 Aug 25;8(16):3673-94;Gene. 1980 Oct;11(1-2):129-48;J Mol Biol. 1980 Oct 25;143(2):161-78;J Mol Biol. 1981 Jan 25;145(3):611-7;Virology. 1981 Oct 30;114(2):463-73;Nucleic Acids Res. 1982 Jan 11;10(1):141-56;Nucleic Acids Res. 1982 May 11;10(9):2971-96;Nucleic Acids Res. 1982 May 11;10(9):2997-3011;Biochemistry. 1982 Jul 6;21(14):3352-8;J Virol. 1982 Oct;44(1):32-46;J Mol Biol. 1982 Dec 25;162(4):877-81	MEDLINE	ppublish

The DNA homology and adsorption specificity of newly isolated virulent bacteriophages of P. aeruginosa have been studied. On the basis of this analysis all phages were divided into four groups: phi k, phi m, phi mnP78-like and phi mnF82-like bacteriophages. DNA's of phi k as well as phi m phages were shown to possess different restriction patterns although they have an extensive homology. Unlike other groups, phi k phages were characterized by the presence of T4 DNA ligase--repaired, single-chain breaks.	200	1	123-7		Kulakov;Ksenzenko;Kochetkov;Mazepa;Boronin	L A;V N;V V;V N;A M		eng	Mol Gen Genet. 1972;114(2):134-43;Biochemistry. 1977 Oct 4;16(20):4478-83;J Virol. 1984 Aug;51(2):553-5;J Mol Biol. 1971 Dec 14;62(2):287-301;Genet Res. 1972 Aug;20(1):137-40;J Mol Biol. 1975 Nov 5;98(3):503-17;Genetika. 1981;17(2):239-45;Science. 1977 Apr 8;196(4286):180-2;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1975 Mar;72(3):989-93;Microbiol Rev. 1979 Mar;43(1):73-102;Nucleic Acids Res. 1976 Apr;3(4):1081-93;Genetika. 1984 Oct;20(10):1612-9;Virology. 1974 Jan;57(1):93-111	MEDLINE	ppublish
